  "body": "### Project Description\r\nThe aim of this project is to annotate a document with a label with semantic analysis. We are testing our algorithm on ACM dataset with the help of wikipedia pages of the categories. \r\n\r\n### Methodology\r\nThe following is the process that we have followed. \r\n* Pre-Process the data like removing alpha-numeric characters, punctuators etc.\r\n* Divide the data into testing and training sets.\r\n* Convert the data into vector space model using Word2Vec and Doc2Vec algorithms.\r\n* Train a classifier with features the word vectors. \r\n* Cross validate and report the results.\r\n\r\n### Source Code\r\n#### ACM\r\n##### run.py\r\nThis code is responsible for representing the dataset into vector space model and the models are saved.\r\n##### pre_process.py\r\nThis code is responsible to make the dataset clean. \r\n##### classify.py \r\nThis code is responsible for training the classifier and also reporting the results of cross-validation.\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\nWe present our analysis using pictorial representation.\r\n\r\nMAP:\r\n![MAP Comparison](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rohitsakala/semanticAnnotationAcmCategories/master/Images/MAP.png \"MAP Comparison\")\r\n\r\nNDCG:\r\n![NDCG Comparison](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rohitsakala/semanticAnnotationAcmCategories/master/Images/NDCG.png \"NDCG Comparison\")\r\n\r\n### Tags\r\n* Information Retrieval and Extraction Course\r\n* IIIT Hyderabad\r\n* Semantic\r\n* Annotation\r\n* Documents\r\n* Word2Vec\r\n* Doc2Vec\r\n* ACM\r\n* Research Papers\r\n* Neural Networks\r\n* KNN\r\n* NDCG\r\n* MAP\r\n* IIIT-H\r\n* Major Project\r\n\r\n### Link to resources\r\n[Presentation](slideshare link)\r\n\r\n[Video](youtube link)\r\n\r\n### Contributors\r\n* Sakala Venkata Krishna Rohit\r\n* Sharvil Katariya\r\n* Nikhil Chavanke\r\n",

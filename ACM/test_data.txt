#!An overview is presented of the use of spatial data structures in spatial databases. The focus is on hierarchical data structures, including a number of variants of quadtrees, which sort the data with respect to the space occupied by it. Such techniques are known as spatial indexing methods. Hierarchical data structures are based on the principle of recursive decomposition. They are attractive because they are compact and depending on the nature of the data they save space as well as time and also facilitate operations such as search. Examples are given of the use of these data structures in the representation of different data types such as regions, points, rectangles, lines, and volumes.

#!The objective of this chapter is an investigation of the applicability of information extraction techniques in real-world business applications dealing with textual data since business relevant data is mainly transmitted through free-text documents. In particular, we give an overview of the information extraction task, designing information extraction systems and some examples of existing information extraction systems applied in the financial, insurance and legal domains. Furthermore, we demonstrate the enormous indexing potential of lightweight linguistic text processing techniques applied in information extraction systems and other closely related fields of information technology which concern processing vast amounts of textual data.

#!This chapter surveys the topic of active rules and active databases. We analyze the state of the art of active databases and active rules, their properties and applications. In particular, we describe the case of triggers following the SQL-1999 Standard Committee point of view. Then, we consider the case of dynamic constraints for which we use a temporal logic formalism. Finally, we discuss the applicability, limitations and partial solutions found when attempting to ensure the satisfaction of dynamic constraints.

#!This chapter focuses on referential link integrity problems. In the industrial context, the life cycle of a document plays a central role in describing the "steps out" of a product. Users realize some manipulations like creation, edition, suppression and querying under a multi-user environment, risking possible destruction or the alteration of the document's integrity. A classical impact is the infamous "Error 404: file not found." However, the user needs a notification alert mechanism to prevent and warrant the coherence of manipulations over all the life cycle processes of a product. The main objective of this chapter is to provide a generic relationship validation mechanism to remedy this shortcoming. We believe in the combination of some standard features of XML, specifically XLL specification as a support for integrity management and Java-Triggers approach as an alert method. This study, compared with actual approaches, proposes a solution based on active functionalities.

#!Since the last decade, images have been integrated into several application domains such as GIS, medicine, etc. This integration necessitates new managing methods particularly in image retrieval. Queries should be formulated using different types of features such as low-level features of images (histograms, color distribution, etc.), spatial and temporal relations between salient objects, semantic features, etc. In this chapter, we propose a novel method for identifying and indexing several types of relations between salient objects. Spatial relations are used here to show how our method can provide high expressive power to relations in comparison to the traditional methods.

#!A composite object represented as a directed graph is an important data structure which requires efficient support in CAD/CAM, CASE, office systems, software management, Web databases and document databases. It is cumbersome to handle such an object in relational database systems when it involves recursive relationships. In this chapter, we present a new encoding method to support the efficient computation of recursion. In addition, we devise a linear time algorithm to identify a sequence of reachable trees (w.r.t.) a directed acyclic graph (DAG), which covers all the edges of the graph. Together with the new encoding method, this algorithm enables us to compute recursion w.r.t, a DAG in time O(e), where e represents the number of edges of the DAG. More importantly, this method is especially suitable for a relational environment.

#!Java is a prevailing implementation platform for XML-based systems. Several high-quality in-memory implementations for the standardized XML-DOM API are available. However, persistency support has not been addressed. In this chapter, we discuss this problem and introduce PDOM (persistent DOM) to accommodate documents as permanent object sets. In addition, we propose a new indexing technique: path signatures to speed up the evaluation of path-oriented queries against document object sets, which is further enhanced by combining the technique of signature-trees with it to expedite scanning of signatures stored in a physical file.

#!Conceptual models are well-known tools to achieve a good design of information systems. Nevertheless, the understanding and use of all the constructs and constraints which are presented in such models are not an easy task and sometimes it is cause of loss of interest.In this chapter we have tried to study in depth and clarify the meaning of the features of conceptual models. The disagreements between main conceptual models, the confusion in the use of some of their constructs and some open problems in these models are shown. Another important topic treated in this chapter is the conceptual-to-logic schemata transformation process.Some solutions are presented in order to clarify the relationship construct and to extend the cardinality constraint concept in ternary relationships. How to preserve the cardinality constraint semantics in binary and ternary relationships for their implementation in a DBMS with active capabilities has also been developed.

#!The integration of knowledge from multiple sources is an important aspect in several areas such as data warehousing, database integration, automated reasoning systems, active reactive databases and others. Thus a central topic in databases is the construction of integration systems, designed for retrieving and querying uniform data stored in multiple information sources. This chapter illustrates recent techniques for computing repairs as well as consistent answers over inconsistent databases. Often databases may be inconsistent with respect to a set of integrity constraints, that is, one or more integrity constraints are not satisfied. Most of the techniques for computing repairs and queries over inconsistent databases work for restricted cases and only recently there have been proposals to consider more general constraints. In this chapter we give an informal description of the main techniques proposed in the literature.

#!Document databases available on the Internet carry massive information resources. To a person needing a piece of information on a specific domain, finding the piece, however, is often quite problematic even though there were a representative collection of databases available on the domain. The languages used in the content, the names of document types, their structures, the ways documents are organized and their retrieval techniques often vary in the databases. The databases containing legal information on the Internet offer a typical example. For finding relevant documents and for being able to interpret the content of the documents correctly, the user may need information about the context where the documents have been created. In this chapter we introduce a method for collecting contextual metadata and for representing the metadata to the users by graphical models. The solution is demonstrated by a case of retrieving information from distributed European legal databases.

#!This chapter addresses the challenge of applying relational database technologies to manage taxonomies, which are commonly used to classify documents, knowledge and websites into a hierarchy of topics. It first describes how denormalizing the data model can facilitate data retrieval from such topic hierarchies. It then shows how the typical data maintenance difficulties associated with denormalized data models can be solved using database triggers.

#!The focus of this chapter is on the progressive adaptation of database techniques to Web usage in a way quite similar to the evolution from integrated file management systems to database management systems. We review related and open issues, such as the semi-structured data and XML, integrity problem, query optimization problem, and integration issues in both the Web and Semantic Web environments. The representation of meta-information along with data opens up a new way to automatically process Web information due to the use of explicit semantic information. We hope that researchers will take into account traditional database techniques and how they can assist new Web technologies. In this sense, the amalgamation of Web and database technology appears to be very promising.

#!With the growing significance of digital libraries and the Internet, more and more electronic texts become accessible to a wide and geographically disperse public. This requires adequate tools to facilitate indexing, storage and retrieval of documents written in different languages. We present a method for semi-automatic indexing of electronic documents and construction of a multilingual thesaurus, which can be used for query formulation and information retrieval. We use special dictionaries and user interaction in order to solve ambiguities and find adequate canonical terms in the language and an adequate abstract language-independent term. The abstract thesaurus is updated incrementally by new indexed documents and is used to search for documents using adequate terms.

#!In explaining functional dependency to students, I have noticed in texts a mixture of two types of elements: intensional (or psychological or meaning) and extensional (patterns of repetition in the data). In this chapter I examine whether it is possible to consider functional dependency, in particular, in second and third normal forms, solely on an extensional basis. The Microsoft Access Analyzer utility seems to do so. I illustrate the mix of intensional and extensional elements in textbook definitions of functional dependency. I conclude that although in principle first, second and third normal form can be done solely by extensional means, in practice intensional considerations are indispensable. Finally, I discuss these questions with respect to the "higher order" normal forms, namely Boyce-Codd, fourth, fifth and Domain/Key normal form.

#!In this chapter, we propose an approach to using keywords (as in a Web search engine) for querying databases over the Web. The approach is based on a Bayesian network model and provides a suitable alternative to the use of interfaces based on multiple forms with several fields. Two major steps are involved when querying a Web database using this approach. First, structured (database-like) queries are derived from a query composed only of the keywords specified by the user. Next, the structured queries are submitted to a Web database, and the retrieved results are presented to the user as ranked answers. To demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, a simple prototype Web search system based on the approach is presented. Experimental results obtained with this system indicate that the approach allows for accurately structuring the user queries and retrieving appropriate answers with minimum intervention from the user.

#!This chapter introduces the process to retrieve units (or subdocuments) of relevant information from XML documents. For this, we use the Extensible Markup Language (XML) which is considered as a new standard for data representation and exchange on the Web. XML opens opportunities to develop a new generation of Information Retrieval System (IRS) to improve the interrogation process of document bases on the Web.Our work focuses instead on end-users who do not have expertise in the domain (like a majority of the end-users). This approach supports keyword-based searching like classical IRS and integrates structured searching with the search attributes notion. It is based on an indexing method of document tree leafs which authorize a content-oriented retrieval. The retrieval subdocuments are ranked according to their similarity with the user's query. We use a similarity measure which is a compromise between two measures: exhaustiveness and specificity.

REF queries are queries involving REF pointers, whereas aggregation queries use either nested table structures or index on clusters. Finally, inheritance queries are queries on inheritance hierarchies.

Business Process Modeling Tools (BPMTs) and Workflow Management Systems (WFMSs) are the most popular tools used for business process transformation and automation of the redesigned business processes within and outside organization's boundaries. This chapter describes a set of criteria for selecting appropriate BPMTs and WFMSs among the diversity of the tools offered in the market in order to assist the interested manager or business process engineer to more successfully manage the business process transformation. While establishing the proposed criteria, we considered currently available technology and standards for visual enterprise support and inter-organizational business process modeling and automation.

#!This chapter proposes a set of metrics to assess data warehouse quality. A set of data warehouse metrics is presented, and the formal and empirical validations that have been done with them. As we consider that information is the main organizational asset, one of our primary duties should be assuring its quality. Although some interesting guidelines have been proposed for designing "good" data models for data warehouses, more objective indicators are needed. Metrics are a useful objective mechanism for improving the quality of software products and also for determining the best ways to help professionals and researchers. In this way, our goal is to elaborate a set of metrics for measuring data warehouse quality which can help designers in choosing the best option among more than one alternative design.

#!Web-based distance learning programs promise learning options anywhere, anytime, to anyone. However, some individuals with disabilities are locked out of these opportunities when courses are designed in such a way that they are inaccessible to individuals using assistive technology. This chapter provides an overview of access challenges for people with disabilities; suggestions for course developers on creating accessible courses; and suggestions for administrators on developing accessiblity policies, guidelines, and procedures.

#!This chapter presents some of the aspects of virtualisation and its role in modern society. In today's world, a controlled virtualisation process creates enormous opportunity for economic growth of those countries and organisations, which, so far, due to various restrictions, have had no chance to become competitive in the global market. Those people and organisations that know how to make use of the opportunities presented by virtualisation may become more effective in business. Moreover, virtualisation creates the best options for intellectual enterprise development. Virtualisation is a very complex process. The author would like to discusses both the positive impact virtualisation can have on society and also some dangers or problems.

#!Since the launch of Google Earth at the latest it is clear that online services for multi-Terabyte satellite imagery are becoming integral part of our Internet experience. Actually, 2-D imagery is but the tip of the iceberg - the general concept of multi-dimensional spatio-temporal raster data covers 1-D sensor time series, 2-D imagery, 3-D image time series (x/y/t) and exploration data (x/y/z), 4-D climate models (x/y/z/t), and many more.

#!While the main goal of a data warehouse is to provide support for data analysis and management's decisions, a fundamental aspect in design of a data warehouse system is the process of acquiring the raw data from a set of relevant information sources. We will call source integration system the component of a data warehouse system dealing with this process. The main goal of a source integration system is to deal with the transfer of data from the set of sources constituting the application-oriented operational environment, to the data warehouse. Since sources are typically autonomous, distributed, and heterogeneous, this task has to deal with the problem of cleaning, reconciling, and integrating data coming from the sources. The design of a source integration system is a very complex task, which comprises several different issues. The purpose of this chapter is to discuss the most important problems arising in the design of a source integration system, with special emphasis on schema integration, processing queries for data integration, and data cleaning and reconciliation.

#!While incomplete information is endemic to real-world data, current multidimensional data models are not engineered to manage incomplete information in base data, derived data, and dimensions. This chapter presents several strategies for managing incomplete information in multidimensional databases. Which strategy to use is dependent on the kind of incomplete information present, and also on where it occurs in the multidimensional database. A relatively simple strategy is to replace incomplete information with appropriate, complete information. The advantage of this strategy is that all multidimensional databases can manage complete information. Other strategies require more substantial changes to the multidimensional database. One strategy is to reflect the incompleteness in computed aggregates, which is possible only if the multidimensional database allows incomplete values in its hierarchies. Another strategy is to measure the amount of incompleteness in aggregated values by tallying how much uncertain information went into their production.

#!When answering queries that ask for, summary statistics, the query-system of a multidimensional database should guard confidential data, that is, it should avoid revealing (directly or indirectly) individual data, which could be exactly calculated or accurately estimated from the values of answered queries. In order to prevent the disclosure of confidential data, the query-system should be provided with an auditing procedure which, each time a new query is processed, checks that its answer does not allow a (knowledgeable) user to disclose any sensitive data. A promising approach consists in keeping track of (or auditing) answered queries by means a dynamic graphical data structure, here called the answer map, whose size increases with the number of answered queries and with the number of dimensions of the database, so that the problem of the existence of an efficient auditing procedure naturally arises. This chapter reviews recent results on this problem for "additive" queries (such as COUNT and SUM queries) by listing some polynomially solvable problems as well as some hard problems, and suggests directions for future work.

#!In spite of the obvious importance of time in data warehousing and OLAP, current commercial systems do not support tracking the history of a data warehouse, either at the schema or instance level. In this chapter we address this issue, introducing the Temporal Multidimensional Model and a query language, denoted TOLAP, allowing expressing temporal OLAP queries at a high level of abstraction. Further, we show that previous work in temporal databases needs to be extended in order to handle evolution and versioning in OLAP. Finally, we present an implementation, along with preliminary experimental results.

#!The purpose of this chapter is to create cooperation between geographic databases (GDBs) and multidimensional databases (MDDBs), which are considered as the most promising and efficient information technologies for supporting decision making. We focus on the common key elements between geographic and multidimensional data which allow effective support in data cooperating. These elements are basically time and space, which are present implicitly or explicitly in MDDB and are modeled on the dimensions, Time and Location. Thus, because GDBs are primarily concerned with geographic data, we will focus on space as a bridge element for cooperating MDDBs and GDBs. We propose an approach that extends the geographic data structure through special attributes, called binding attributes, in order to describe all phenomena represented by MDDBs. This extension will make it possible to answer more specific "OLAP-based" queries within GDBs without modifying the physical organization of data in both environments.

We give an overview of the related works on the basic concepts of the different types of aggregation hierarchies. We then discuss the hierarchies from two different points of view: mapping between domain values and hierarchical structures. In relation to them, we introduce the characterization of some OLAP operators on hierarchies and give a set of operators that concern the change in the hierarchy structure. Finally, we propose an enlargement of the operator set concerning hierarchies.

#!This chapter presents the basic notions regarding multidimensional (aggregate) databases by referring to different definitions given for them in the literature. It illustrates the important concepts of micro, macro, and metadata; presents a formal definition of the aggregation process, discussing the concepts of dimension and dimension hierarchies; describes the multidimensional aggregate data structure, distinguishing between simple, complex, and composite structure; illustrates the different types of null values; and discusses differences and similarities which exist between multidimensional aggregate data (generally called statistical data because they are used mainly by statisticians) and the On-Line-Analytic Processing (OLAP) of multidimensional data represented by different data cubes, also discussing the different (symmetric and nonsymmetric) treatment of dimensions and measures required by OLAP and aggregate multidimensional databases. Finally it discusses a graph model and a tabular model for this kind of data, and gives a set of definitions regarding the OLAP terminology.

#!In this chapter the author proposes the different approaches for defining operators able to manipulate this multidimensional structure. In particular, he initially considers operators for multidimensional aggregate data which extend relational algebra and relational calculus (the so-called enlarged relational model). Then he discusses operators for multidimensional aggregate data defined in a tabular environment. In both the cases the author defines such data as statistical (aggregate) data. Subsequently he introduces the operators for OLAP applications, giving a terminology correspondence between the multidimensional aggregate (statistical) databases and OLAP areas. Then he defines the fundamental operators deduced from the previous ones, which form the basic algebra for the manipulation of multidimensional aggregate data, giving their formal definitions and some explanatory examples.

#!Data cubes are ubiquitous tools in data warehousing, online analytical processing, and decision support applications. Based on a selection of pre-computed and materialized aggregate values, they can dramatically speed up aggregation and summarization over large data collections. Traditionally, the emphasis has been on lowering query costs with little regard to maintenance, i.e., update cost issues. We argue that current trends require data cubes to be not only query-efficient, but also dynamic at the same time, and we also show how this can be achieved. Several array-based techniques with different tradeoffs between query and update cost are discussed in detail. We also survey selected approaches for sparse data and the popular data cube operator, CUBE. Moreover, this work includes an overview of future trends and their impact on data cubes.

#!The term "multidimensional databses" refers to data that can be viewed conceptually in a multidimensional space, where each dimension represents some attributes of the data. Viewing data in this form is natural for many applications, yet the concepts are not treated in a uniform way in the database literature. In this chapter, we show the commonality of concepts between three database areas: statistical, OLAP, and scientific databases. We show that these domains have two main structural concepts: the cross-product space of the dimensions, and the classification hierarchy structure associated with each dimension. In the first part of this chapter we describe how these structures are sed to represent data in statistical and OLAP databases and how summarization operators can be applied to them. Further, we discuss how these structures can be extended to represent related information using federated database concepts. In the second part of the chapter we show that these concepts are common to many scientific database application. In particular, we discuss the importance of supporting classification structures and the difficulty in representing them as tables in relational databases. We also discuss data structures to support multidimensional databases, emphasizing space-time representation, clustering in multidimensional space, indexing in multidimensional space, and supporting classification structures. We conclude by arguing that the concepts of multidimensionality and classification structures as well as the operation over them should be elevated to "first class" object types. These object types should be visible by the application user explicitly in the conceptual schemas as well as exposing them in the user interfaces.

#!A powerful and easy-to-use querying environment is certainly one of the most important components in a multidimensional database, and its effectiveness is influenced by many other aspects, both logical (data model, integration, policy of view materialization, etc.) and physical (multidimensional or relational storage, indexes, etc.). As is evident, multidimensional querying is often based on the metaphor of the data cube and on the concepts of facts, measures, and dimensions. In contrast to conventional transactional environments, multidimensional querying is often an exploratory process, performed by navigating along the dimensions and measures, increasing/decreasing the level of detail and focusing on specific subparts of the cube that appear to be "promising" for the required information.In this chapter we focus on the main languages proposed in the literature to express multidimensional queries, particularly those based on: (i) an algebraic approach, (ii) a declarative paradigm (calculus), and (iii) visual constructs and syntax. We analyze the problem of evaluation, i.e., the issues related to the efficient data retrieval and calculation, possibly (often necessarily) using some pre-computed data, a problem known in the literature as the problem of rewriting a query using views. We also illustrate the use of particular index structures to speed up the query evaluation process.

#!A variety of multidimensional data models have recently been proposed by both academic and industry communities. but consensus on formalism or even a common terminology has not yet emerged. In this chapter, we first discuss the requirements that an ideal conceptual multidimensional model should fulfill. These requirements are suggested by general information system modeling principles and the specific characteristics of OLAP applications. Building on these requirements, we then present a general conceptual multidimensional data model and show how it can be used to describe the basic aspects of a business application in a way that is easy to understand and independent of the criteria for actual data organization in the various systems. Starting from the characteristics of the model proposed, we summarize the general features that a multidimensional conceptual model should support. We then survey various multidimensional models proposed and relate their characteristics to these general features. Finally, we discuss the main points raised in the chapter and some problems that remain to be solved in this context.

#!Active database applications require the classic cycle of analysis, design, prototyping and implementation. During analysis and design steps of the information system engineering process, modeling behavior is an important task. This task is both essential and crucial when information system is centered on active databases, which allow the replacement of parts of application programs with active rules. For that reason, the specification of business rules during analysis and design steps becomes an actual requirement. Business rules ensure the well-functioning of information system. They are descriptive (integrity constraints) or functional (derivation rules and active rules). To relieve programmers from using either traditional or ad hoc techniques to design active databases, it is necessary to develop new techniques to model business rules. These techniques have to enhance the specification of dynamic aspect through a high-level description language able to express precisely and completely rule semantic. In this chapter, we propose a uniform approach to model business rules (active rules, integrity constraints, etc.). To improve the behavior specification we extend the state diagrams that are widely used for dynamic modeling. This extension is a transformation of state transitions according to rule semantics. In addition, we outline new functionalities of Computer-Aided System Engineering (CASE) to take into consideration the active database specificities. In this way, the designer can be assisted to control, maintain and reuse a set of rules.

#!With the ubiquitous availability of browsers and Internet access, the last few years have seen a tremendous growth in the number of applications being developed on the World Wide Web (WWW). Models for analyzing and designing these applications are only just beginning to emerge. In this work, we propose a three-dimensional classification space for WWW applications, consisting of a degree of structure of pages dimension, a degree of support for interrelated events dimension and a location of processing dimension. Next, we propose usability design metrics for WWW applications along the structure of pages dimension. To measure these, we propose CMU-WEB-a conceptual model that can be used to design WWW applications, such that its schema provide values for the design metrics. This work represents the first effort, to the best of our knowledge, to provide a conceptual model that measures quantifiable metrics that can be used for the design of more usable Web applications, and that can also be used to compare the usability of existing Web applications, without empirical testing.

#*Enforcing Cardinality Constraints in the ER Model with Integrity Methods.

#!Entity-Relationship (ER) schemas include cardinality constraints that restrict the dependencies among entities within a relationship type. The cardinality constraints have direct impact on application transactions, since insertions or deletions of entities or relationships might affect related entities. Application transactions can be strengthened to preserve the consistency of a database with respect to the cardinality constraints in a schema. Yet, once an ER schema is translated into a logical database schema, the direct correlation between the cardinality constraints and application transaction is lost, since the components of the ER schema might be decomposed among those of the logical database schema.We suggest extending the Enhanced-ER (EER) data model with integrity methods that can enforce the cardinality constraints. The integrity methods can be fully defined by the cardinality constraints, using a small number of primitive update methods, and are automatically created for a given EER diagram. A translation of an EER schema into a logical database schema can create integrity routines by translating the primitive update methods alone. These integrity routines may be implemented as database procedures, if a relational DBMS is utilized, or as class methods, if an object-oriented DBMS is utilized.

#!In a distributed database system, an increase in workload typically necessitates the installation of additional database servers followed by the implementation of expensive data reorganization strategies. We present the Partial REALLOCATE and Full REALLOCATE heuristics for efficient data reallocation. Complexity is controlled and cost minimized by allowing only incremental introduction of servers into the distributed database system. Using first simple examples and then, a simulator, our framework for incremental growth and data reallocation in distributed database systems is shown to produce near optimal solutions when compared with exhaustive methods.

#!A use case is a description of a sequence of actions constituting a complete task or transaction in an application. Use cases were first proposed by Jacobson (1987) and have since been incorporated as one of the key modeling constructs in the UML(Booch, Jacobson, & Rumbaugh, 1999) and the Unified Software Development Process(Jacobson, Booch, & Rumbaugh, 1999). This chapter traces the development of use cases, and identifies a number of problems with both their application and theoretical underpinnings. From an application perspective, the use-case concept is marked by a high degree of variety in the level of abstraction versus implementation detail advocated by various authors. In addition, use cases are promoted as a primary mechanism for identifying objects in an application, even though they focus on processes rather than objects. Moreover, there is an apparent inconsistency between the so-called naturalness of object models and the commonly held view that use cases should be the primary means of communicating and verifying requirements with users. From a theoretical standpoint, the introduction of implementation issues in use cases can be seen as prematurely anchoring the analysis to particular implementation decisions. In addition, the fragmentation of objects across use cases creates conceptual difficulties in developing a comprehensive class diagram from a set of use cases. Moreover, the role of categorization in human thinking suggests that class diagrams may serve directly as a good mechanism for communicating and verifying application requirements with users. We conclude by outlining a framework for further empirical research to resolve issues raised in our analysis.

#!Object-Process Methodology (OPM) is a system development and specification approach that combines the major system aspects-function, structure and behavior-within a single graphic and textual model. Having applied OPM in a variety of domains, this chapter specifies an electronic commerce system in a hierarchical manner, at the top of which are the processes of managing a generic product supply chain before and after the product is manufactured. Focusing on the post-product supply chain management, we gradually refine the details of the fundamental, almost "classical" electronic commerce interaction between the retailer and the end-customer, namely payment over the Internet using the customer's credit card. The specification results in a set of Object-Process Diagrams and a corresponding equivalent set of Object-Process Language sentences. The synergy of combining structure and behavior within a single formal model, expressed both graphically and textually, yields a highly expressive system modeling and specification tool. The comprehensive, unambiguous treatment of this basic electronic commerce process is formal, yet intuitive and clear, suggesting that OPM is a prime candidate for becoming a common standard vehicle for defining, specifying, and analyzing electronic commerce and supply chain management systems.

#!Since its adoption by the Object Management Group as a language for object-oriented analysis and design, the Unified Modeling Language (UML) has become widely used for designing object-oriented code. However, UML has had only minimal adoption among practitioners for the purposes of information analysis and database design. One main reason for this is that the class diagrams used in UML for data modeling provide only weak, and awkward, support for the kinds of business rules found in data-intensive applications. Moreover, UML's graphical language does not lend itself readily to verbalization and multiple instantiation for validating data models with domain experts. These defects can be remedied by using a fact-oriented approach for information analysis, from which UML class diagrams may be derived. Object-Role Modeling (ORM) is currently the most popular fact-oriented modeling approach. This chapter examines the relative strengths and weaknesses of UML and ORM for conceptual data modeling, and indicates how models in one notation can be translated into the other.

#!As database users adopt a query language to obtain information from a database, a more intelligent query answering system is increasingly needed that cooperates with the users to provide informative responses by understanding the intent behind a query. The effectiveness of decision support would improve significantly if the query answering system returned approximate answers rather than a null information response when there is no matching data available. Even when exact answers are found, neighboring information is still useful to users if the query is intended to explore some hypothetical information or abstract general fact. This chapter proposes an abstraction hierarchy as a framework to practically derive such approximate answers from ordinary everyday databases. It provides a knowledge abstraction database to facilitate the approximate query answering. The knowledge abstraction database specifically adopts an abstraction approach to extract semantic data relationships from the underlying database, and uses a multi-level hierarchy for coupling multiple levels of abstraction knowledge and data values. In cooperation with the underlying database, the knowledge abstraction database allows the relaxation of query conditions so that the original query scope can be broadened and thus information approximate to exact answers can be obtained. Conceptually abstract queries can also be posed to provide a less rigid query interface. A prototype system has been implemented at KAIST and is being tested with a personnel database system to demonstrate the usefulness and practicality of the knowledge abstraction database in ordinary database systems.

#!Electronic documents have become a universal way of communication due to Web expansion. But using structured information stored in databases is still essential for data coherence management, querying facilities, etc. We thus face a classical problem-known as "impedance mismatch" in the database world; two antagonist approaches have to collaborate. Using documents at the end-user interface level provides simplicity and flexibility. But it is possible to take documents as data sources only if helped by a human being; automatic document analysis systems have a significant error rate. Databases are an alternative as semantics and format of information are strict; queries via SQL provide 100% correct responses. The aim of this work is to provide a system that associates document capture freedom with database storage structure.The system we propose does not intend to be universal. It can be used in specific cases where people usually work with technical documents dedicated to a particular domain. Our examples concern medicine and more explicitly medical records. Computerization has very often been rejected by physicians because it necessitates too much standardization and form-based user interfaces are not easily adapted to their daily practice. In this domain, we think that this study provides a viable alternative approach. This system offers freedom to doctors; they would fill in documents with the information they want to store, in a convenient order and in a freer way. We have developed a system that allows a database to fill in quasi-automatically from documents paragraphs.The database used is an already existing database that can be queried in a classical way for statistical studies or epidemiological purposes. In this system, the document fund and the database containing extractions from dccuments coexist. Queries are sent to the database, answers include data from the database and references to source documents.

#!FOOM is an integrated methodology for analysis and design of information systems, which combines the two essential software-engineering paradigms: the functional- (or process-) oriented approach and the object-oriented (OO) approach. In FOOM, system analysis includes both functional and data modeling activities, thereby producing both a functional model and a data model. These activities can be performed either by starting with functional analysis and continuing with data modeling, or vice versa. FOOM products of the analysis phase include:a)a hierarchy of OO-DFDs (object-oriented data flow diagrams), and b) an initial object schema, which can be created directly from the user requirements specification or from an entity-relationship diagram (ERD) that is mapped to that object schema. System design is performed according to the OO approach. The products of the design phase include: a) a complete object schema, consisting of the classes and their relationships, attributes, and method interfaces; b) object classes for the menus, forms and reports; and c) a behavior schema, which consists of detailed descriptions of the methods and the application transactions, expressed in pseudo-code and message diagrams. The seamless transition from analysis to design is attributed to ADISSA methodology, which facilitates the design of the menus, forms and reports classes, and the system behavior schema, from DFDs and the application transactions.

#!Information modeling is the cornerstone of information systems analysis and design. Information models, the products of information modeling, not only provide the abstractions required to facilitate communication between the analysts and end-users, but they also provide a formal basis for developing tools and techniques used in information systems development. The process of designing, constructing, and adapting information modeling methods for information systems development is known as method engineering. Despite the pivotal role of modeling methods in successful information systems development, most modeling methods are designed based on common sense and intuition of the method designers with little or no theoretical foundation or empirical evidence. Systematic scientific approach is missing! This chapter proposes the use of cognitive psychology as a reference discipline for information modeling and method engineering. Theories in cognitive psychology are reviewed in this chapter and their application to information modeling and method engineering is discussed.

#!Unified Modeling Language (UML)has emerged as the software industry's dominant modeling language. It is the de facto modeling language standard for specifying, visualizing, constructing, and documenting the components of software systems. Despite its prominence and status as the standard modeling language, UML has its critics. Opponents argue that it is complex and difficult to learn. Some question the rationale of having nine diagramming techniques in UML and the raison d'être of those nine techniques in UML. Others point out that UML lacks a comprehensive methodology to guide its users, which makes the language even more convoluted. A few studies on UML can be found in the literature. However, no study exists to provide a quantitative measure of UML complexity or to compare UML with other object-oriented techniques. In this research, we evaluate the complexity of UML using complexity metrics. The objective is to provide a reliable and accurate quantitative measure of UML complexity. A comparison of the complexity metrical values of UML with other object-oriented techniques was also carried out. Our findings suggest that each diagram in UML is not distinctly more complex than techniques in other modeling methods. But as a whole, UML is very complex-2-11 times more complex than other modeling methods.

#!Recently, many organizations have attempted to build hypermedia systems to expand their working areas into Internet-based virtual work places. Increasingly, it becomes more important than ever to manage organizational hypermedia documents (OHDs); metadata plays a critical role for managing these documents. This chapter redefines metadata roles and proposes a metadata classification and the corresponding metadata schema for OHDs. Furthermore, a meta-information system, HyDoMiS (Hyperdocument Meta-information System) built on the basis of this schema is proposed. HyDoMiS performs three functions: metadata management, search, and reporting. The metadata management function is concerned with workflow, documents, and databases. The system is more likely to help implement and maintain hypermedia information systems effectively.

#!In the design of multimedia database systems, one of the most important issues is to extract images dynamically according to the user's impression and the image's contents. In this paper, we present a metadatabase system which realizes the semantic associative search for images by giving keywords representing the user's impression and the image's contents.This metadatabase system provides several functions for performing the semantic associative search for images by using the metadata representing the features of images. These functions are realized by using our proposed mathematical model of meaning. The mathematical model of meaning is extended to compute specific meanings of keywords which are used for retrieving images unambiguously and dynamically. The main feature of this model is that the semantic associative search is performed in the orthogonal semantic space. This space is created for dynamically computing semantic equivalence or similarity between the metadata items of the images and keywords.

#!The type system of the logic programming language $\lambda$Prolog is discussed. The incorporation of higher-order notions within this language requires the use of a typing scheme to distinguish between expressions of different function types. Thus $\lambda$Prolog is a (strongly) typed language, in contrast to the typeless language that underlies the idea of descriptive types in logic programming. The typing discipline that is employed in the language is based on the notion of simple types in the $\lambda$-calculus. This form of typing enforces arity restrictions on functions and predicates and provides a builtin functional hierarchy over terms. The language contains a facility for defining new primitive types and thus permits finer grained distinctions to be introduced by the user. Further, the use of type variables and type constructors provides a form of polymorphism that is similar in certain respects to that present in the language ML. The notion of type checking in $\lambda$Prolog is discussed and shown to be an operation that can be performed at the time of compilation. The value of typing distinctions in determining the clarity of programs and their usefulness in conjunction with type checking in preventing run-time errors due to type violations is also discussed. In addition to their function in type checking, types also have a major role in determining computations in the logic programming context. We discuss this aspect of types that is in contrast to their behavior in other programming paradigms and we show how this leads to a presence of types in the runtime environment. While typing has several advantages, it is sometimes to the programmer''s advantage to be able to omit their mention. Type reconstruction provides a means for filling missing type information in and we discuss issues pertinent to this process in the context of $\lambda$Prolog.

#!We demonstrate the power of object identities (oid's) as a database query language primitive. We develop an object-based data model, whose structural part generalizes most of the known complex-object data models: cyclicity is allowed in both its schemas and instances. Our main contribution is the operational part of the data model, the query language IQL, which uses oid's for three critical purposes: (1) to represent data-structures with sharing and cycles, (2) to manipulate sets and (3) to express any computable database query. IQL can be statically type checked, can be evaluated bottom-up and naturally generalizes most popular rule-based database languages. The model can also be extended to incorporate type inheritance, without changes to IQL. Finally, we investigate an analogous value-based data model, whose structural part is founded on regular infinite trees and whose operational part is IQL.

#!The concept of method schemas is proposed as a simple model for object-oriented programming with features such as classes with methods and inheritance, method name overloading, and late binding. An important issue is to check whether a given method schema can possibly lead to inconsistencies in some interpretations. The consistency problem for method schemas is studied. The problem is shown to be undecidable in general. Decidability is obtained for monadic and/or recursion-free method schemas. The effect of covariance is considered. The issues of incremental consistency checking and of a sound algorithm for the general case are briefly discussed.

#!The Altair group is currently designing an object-oriented data base system called O2. This paper presents a formal description of the object-oriented data model of this system. It proposes a type system defined in the framework of a set-and-tuple data model. It models the well known inheritance mechanism and enforces strong typing.

#!ACTA is a comprehensive transaction framework that permits a transaction modeler to specify the effects of extended transactions on each other and on objects in the database. ACTA allows the specification of (1) the interactions between transactions in terms of relationships between significant (transaction manage- ment) events, such as begin, commit, abort, delegate, split, and join, pertaining to different transactions and (2) transactions'' effects on objects'' state and concur- rency status (i.e., synchronization state). Various extended traditional models have been proposed to deal with applica- tions that involve reactive (endless), open-ended (long-lived) and collaborative (interactive) activities. One such model is Sagas [GS87] independent (component) transactions T1, T2,..., Tn which can interleave in any way with component trans- actions of other Sagas. Components can commit even before the Saga commits. However, if the Saga subsequently aborts, effects of the committed components are nullified through the invocation of compensating transactions. After giving a brief introduction to the modeling primitives of ACTA, we illustrate their use by giving a complete formal characterization of Sagas. Sub- sequently, the reasoning power of ACTA is shown by proving properties of Sagas. Finally, the flexibility of ACTA is displayed through a series of variations to the original model of Sagas, each variation coming out of changes to the formal characterization of Sagas.

#!Recently, F-logic has been proposed as an attempt to extend deductive databases by typical concepts of object-oriented languages. Among these concepts are complex objects, (term-based) object identity, methods, classes, typing, inheritance and browsing. In Kifer et al. syntax and model-theoretic semantics is discussed; however many algorithmic aspects which arise when computing the corresponding models are left open. In this paper we start to bridge this gap. Several topics in the context of the evaluation of programs are discussed in detail; among these are weak recursion, global stratification and dynamic type-checking.

#!Datalog programs, i.e., Prolog programs without function symbols, are considered It is assumed that a variable appearing in the head of a rule must also appear in the body of the rule. The input of a program is a set of ground atoms (which are given in addition to the program's rules) and, therefore, can be viewed as an assignment of relations to some of the program's predicates. Two programs are equivalent if they produce the same result for all possible assignments of relations to the extensional predicates (i.e., the predicates that do not appear as heads of rules). Two programs are uniformly equivalent if they produce the same result for all possible assignments of initial relations to all the predicates (i.e., both extensional and intentional). The equivalence problem for Datalog programs is known to be undecidable. It is shown that uniform equivalence is decidable, and an algorithm is given for minimizing a Datalog program under uniform equivalence. A technique for removing parts of a program that are redundant under equivalence (but not under uniform equivalence) is developed. A procedure for testing uniform equivalence is also developed for the case in which the database satisfies some constraints.

#!The Software Abstract is intended to tell its reader enough about the software to know where to find all the other information that exists about it, anywhere. A copy of the Abstract opens every document about the software. It has a fairly rigid format, so a sequence of Abstracts can be scanned swiftly, the same information always being found at the same place. The format of the Software Abstract is defined in Figure 1. Although most Software Abstracts are written to define individual programs, the format is also an effective tool for describing any software entity: subroutine, program, software system or subsystem, data file, or library. It has even been used successfully to document books and articles about documenting (Schneider, French, Lucas 77). The Abstract is constrained to fit on one side of one sheet of paper. This is the reason that certain sections of the Abstract are considered optional.An Example of Software Abstract is shown in Figure 2. The example demonstrates the considerable informational latitude that can be incorporated into a Software Abstract without violating the strict format guidelines.

#!CommonLoops blends object-oriented programming smoothly and tightly with the procedure-oriented design of Lisp. Functions and methods are combined in a more general abstraction. Message passing is invoked via normal Lisp function call. Methods are viewed as partial descriptions of procedures. Lisp data types are integrated with object classes. With these integrations, it is easy to incrementally move a program between the procedure and object-oriented styles.One of the most important properties of CommonLoops is its extensive use of meta-objects. We discuss three kinds of meta-objects: objects for classes, objects for methods, and objects for discriminators. We argue that these meta-objects make practical both efficient implementation and experimentation with new ideas for object-oriented programming.CommonLoops' small kernel is powerful enough to implement the major object-oriented systems in use today.

#!A reasonably comprehensive set of data accessing and manipulation operations that should be supported by a generalized pictorial database management system (PDBMS) is proposed. A corresponding high-level query language, PICQUERY, is presented and illustrated through examples. PICQUERY has been designed with a flavor similar to QBE as the highly nonprocedural and conservational language for the pictorial database management system PICDMS. PICQUERY and a relational QBE-like language would form the language by which a user could access conventional relational databases and at the same time pictorial databases managed by PICDMS or other robust PDBMS. This languageinterface is part of an architecture aimed toward data heterogeneity transparency over pictorial and nonpictorial databases.

#!Object-oriented concepts can make a design database more reactive to changes in its contents. By embedding change semantics in the database model, the design engineer can be relieved of managing the detailed effects of changes. However, mechanisms are needed to limit the scope of change propagation and to unambiguously identify the objects to which propagated changes should apply. We propose new mechanisms based on group check-in/check-out, browser contexts and paths, configuration constraints, and rules, to support a powerful automatic change capability within a design database.

#!There are two major issues to address to achieve integration of an object-oriented programming system with a database system. One is the language issue: an object-oriented programming language must be augmented with semantic data modeling concepts to provide a robust set of data modeling concepts to allow modeling of entities for important real-world applications. Another is the computational-model issue: application programmers should be able to access and manipulate objects as though the objects are in an infinite virtual memory; in other words, they should not have to be aware of the existence of a database system in their computations with the data structures the programming language allows. This paper discusses these issues and presents the solutions which we have incorporated into the ORION object-oriented database system at MCC.

#!We describe the results of developing the GemStone object-oriented database server, which supports a model of objects similar to that of Smalltalk-80. We begin with a summary of the goals and requirements for the system: an extensible data model that captures behavioral semantics, no artificial bounds on the number or size of database objects, database amenities (concurrency, transactions, recovery, associative access, authorization) and an interactive development environment. Object-oriented languages, Smalltalk in particular, answer some of these requirements. We discuss satisfying the remaining requirements in an object oriented context, and report briefly on the status of the development efforts. This paper is directed at an audience familiar with object-oriented languages and their implementation, but perhaps unacquainted with the difficulties and techniques of database system development. It updates the original report on the project [CM], and expands upon a more recent article [MDP].

#!Up to this point direct implementations of axiomatic or equational specifications have been limited because the implementation mechanisms used are incapable of capturing the full semantics of the specifications. The programming language Unicorn was designed and implemented with the intention of exploring the full potential of programming with equations. Unicorn introduces a new language mechanism, called constraining-unification. When coupled with semantic unification, constraining-unification closely models the semantics of equational specifications thereby allowing for the implementation of a wider class of specifications. Unlike the language mechanisms of rewrite-rule and logic programming, constraining-unification is free of order dependencies. The same results are produced regardless of the order in which the axioms are stated. The use of viewpoints contributes to the flexibility of the Unicorn language. Preconditions for partial operations can be specified without added machinery.

#!Uniform is an AI programming language under development based upon augmented unification. It is an attempt to combine, in a simple coherent-framework, the most important features of Lisp, actor languages such as Act 1 and SmallTalk, and logic programming languages such as Prolog. Among the unusual abilities of the language is its ability to use the same program as a function, an inverse function, a predicate, a pattern, or a generator. All of these uses can be performed upon concrete, symbolic, and partially instantiated data. Uniform features automatic inheritance from multiple super classes, facilities for manipulation of programs, a limited ability to determine program equivalence, and a unification-oriented database.

#!The language Prolog has been extended by allowing the inclusion of assertions about equality. When a unification of two terms that do not unify syntactically is attempted, an equality theorem may be used to prove the two terms equal. If it is possible to prove that the two terms are equal the unification succeeds with the variable bindings introduced by the equality proof. It is shown that this mechanism significantly improves the power of Prolog. Sophisticated data abstraction with all the advantages of object-oriented programming is available. Techniques for passing partially instantiated data are described that extends the "multiuse" capabilities of the language, improve the efficiency of some programs, and allow the implementation of arithmetic relations that are both general and efficient. The modifications to standard Prolog are simple and straightforward and in addition the computational overhead for the extra linguistic power is not significant. Equality theorems will probably play an important role in future logic programming systems.

#!A number of recent studies have examined the performance of concurrency control algorithms for database management systems. The results reported to date, rather than being definitive, have tended to be contradictory. In this paper, rather than presenting &ldquo;yet another algorithm performance study,&rdquo; we critically investigate the assumptions made in the models used in past studies and their implications. We employ a fairly complete model of a database environment for studying the relative performance of three different approaches to the concurrency control problem under a variety of modeling assumptions. The three approaches studied represent different extremes in how transaction conflicts are dealt with, and the assumptions addressed pertain to the nature of the database system's resources, how transaction restarts are modeled, and the amount of information available to the concurrency control algorithm about transactions' reference strings. We show that differences in the underlying assumptions explain the seemingly contradictory performance results. We also address the question of how realistic the various assumptions are for actual database systems.

#!A specialized data flow graph, Database Flow Graph (DBFG) is introduced. DBFGs may be used for scheduling database operations, particularly in an MIMD database machine environment. A DBFG explicitly maintains intertransaction and intratransaction dependencies, and is constructed from the Transaction Flow Graphs (TFG) of active transactions. A TFG, in turn, is the generalization of a query tree used, for example, in DIRECT [15]. All DBFG schedules are serializable and deadlock free. Operations needed to create and maintain the DBFG structure as transactions are added or removed from the system are discussed. Simulation results show that DBFG scheduling performs as well as two-phase locking.

#!In this chapter, we consider algorithms that permit every site in a partitioned database system to perform new updates. Since this may result in independent updates to items in different partitions, conflicts among transactions are bound to occur. Commutative transactions can be used to reduce the number of these conflicts. We develop a probabilistic model to estimate the possible reduction in conflicts if we incorporate this notion of commutativity. The results show that the additional efforts to recognize this commutativity is not beneficial unless the number of transactions that commute with each other is significantly large.

#!An explanatory overview is given of DIAGRAM, a large and complex grammar used in an artificial intelligence system for interpreting English dialogue. DIAGRAM is an augmented phrase-structure grammar with rule procedures that allow phrases to inherit attributes from their constituents and to acquire attributes from the larger phrases in which they themselves are constituents. These attributes are used to set context-sensitive constraints on the acceptance of an analysis. Constraints can be imposed by conditions on dominance as well as by conditions on constituency. Rule procedures can also assign scores to an analysis to rate it as probable or unlikely. Less likely analyses can be ignored by the procedures that interpret the utterance. For every expression it analyzes, DIAGRAM provides an annotated description of the structure. The annotations supply important information for other parts of the system that interpret the expression in the context of a dialogue. Major design decisions are explained and illustrated. Some contrasts with transformational grammars are pointed out and problems that motivate a plan to use metarules in the future are discussed. (Metarules derive new rules from a set of base rules to achieve the kind of generality previously captured by transformational grammars but without having to perform transformations on syntactic analyses.)

#!Formal specifications that precisely and correctly define the semantics of software systems become increasingly important as the complexity of such systems increase. The emerging set of semantic data models which support both structural and operational abstractions are excellent tools for formal specifications. In this paper we introduce a methodology, based on an object-oriented data model, for the design and development of large software systems. The methodology is demonstrated by applying the object-oriented data model to the specification of a database system which implements the given model. The specification serves several purposes: it formally defines the precise semantics of the operations of the data model, it provides a basis from which the corresponding database system software can be systematically derived, and it tests and demonstrates the adequacy of such a model for defining software systems in general. The design methodology introduced combines techniques from data modeling, formal specifications, and software engineering.

#!This paper describes the design and proposed implementation of a shared object hierarchy. The object hierarchy is stored in a relational database and objects referenced by an application program are cached in the program's address space. The paper describes the database representation for the object hierarchy and the use of POSTGRES, a next-generation relational database management system, to implement object referencing efficiently. The shared object hierarchy system will be used to implement Object FADS, an object-oriented programming environment for interactive database applications that will be the main programming interface to POSTGRES.

#!This paper presents the object management facilities being designed into a next-generation data manager, POSTGRES. This system is unique in that it does not invent a new data model for support of objects but chooses instead to extend the relational model with a powerful abstract data typing capability and procedures as full-fledged data base objects. The reasons to remain with the relational model are indicated in this paper along with the POSTGRES relational extensions.

#!Summary: A structured folding pathway, which is a time ordered sequence of folding events, plays an important role in the protein folding process and hence, in the conformational search. Pathway prediction, thus gives more insight into the folding process and is a valuable guiding tool to search the conformation space. In this paper, we propose a novel 'unfolding' approach to predict the folding pathway. We apply graph-based methods on a weighted secondary structure graph of a protein to predict the sequence of unfolding events. When viewed in reverse this yields the folding pathway. We demonstrate the success of our approach on several proteins whose pathway is partially known.

#!This article presents a taxonomy of strategies for fully-automated general-purpose first-order theorem proving. It covers forward-reasoning ordering-based strategies and backward-reasoning subgoal-reduction strategies, which do not appear together often. Unlike traditional presentations that emphasize logical inferences, this classification strives to give equal weight to the inference and search components of theorem proving, which are equally important in practice. For this purpose, a formal notion of search plan is given and shown to apply to all classes of strategies. For each class, the form of derivation is specified, and it is shown how inference system and search plan cooperate to generate it.

#!Reasoning about stochastic dynamical systems and planning under uncertainty has come to play a fundamental role in AI research and applications. The representation of such systems, in particular, of actions with stochastic effects, has accordingly been given increasing attention in recent years. In this article, we survey a number of techniques for representing stochastic processes and actions with stochastic effects using dynamic Bayesian networks and influence diagrams, and briefly describe how these support effective inference for tasks such as monitoring, forecasting, explanation and decision making. We also compare these techniques to several action representations adopted in the classical reasoning about action and planning communities, describing how traditional problems such as the frame and ramification problems are dealt with in stochastic settings, and how these solutions compare to recent approaches to this problem in the classical (deterministic) literature. We argue that while stochastic dynamics introduce certain complications when it comes to such issues, for the most part, intuitions underlying classical models can be extended to the stochastic setting.

#!The Word Wide Web was born as an Internet service supporting a simple distributed hypertext management system. Since its start a number of technologies have been proposed to enhance its capabilities. In this paper we describe our concept of an active Web, namely how we design the software architecture of interactive cooperative applications based on the Word Wide web. An active Web includes agents able to use the services offered by Word Wide web clients and servers. In an active Web both users and agents can interoperate using a set of basic mechanisms for communication and synchronization. The active Web we describe here is based on coordination technology: we explore two alternative implementations, both based on Java enriched with alternative coordination kernels.

#!Recently model checking representation and search techniques were shown to be efficiently applicable to planning, in particular to non-deterministic planning. Such planning approaches use Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (OBDDS) to encode a planning domain as a non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA) and then apply fast algorithms from model checking to search for a solution. OBDDS can effectively scale and can provide universal plans for complex planning domains. We are particularly interested in addressing the complexities arising in non-deterministic, multi-agent domains. In this chapter, we present UMOP,1 a new universal OBDD-based planning framework for non-deterministic, multi-agent domains, which is also applicable to deterministic singleagent domains as a special case. We introduce a new planning domain description language, NADL,2 to specify non-deterministic multi-agent domains. The language contributes the explicit definition of controllable agents and uncontrollable environment agents. We describe the syntax and semantics of NADL and show how to build an efficient OBDD-based representation of an NADL description. The UMOP planning system uses NADL and different OBDD-based universal planning algorithms. It includes the previously developed strong and strong cyclic planning algorithms [9,10]. In addition, we introduce our new optimistic planning algorithm, which relaxes optimality guarantees and generates plausible universal plans in some domains where no strong or strong cyclic solution exist. We present empirical results from domains ranging from deterministic and single-agent with no environment actions to nondeterministic and multi-agent with complex environment actions. UMOP is shown to be a rich and efficient planning system.

The key challenges in data integration arise because the data sources being integrated have been designed independently for autonomous applications, and their contents are related in subtle ways. As a result, a data integration system requires rich formalisms for describing contents of data sources and relating between contents of different sources. This paper discusses works aimed at applying techniques from Artificial Intelligence to the problem of data integration. In addition to employing Knowledge Representation techniques for describing contents of information sources, projects have also made use of Machine Learning techniques for extracting data from sources and planning techniques for query optimization. The paper also outlines future opportunities for applying AI techniques in the context of data integration.

#!Believable agents are autonomous agents that exhibit rich personalities. Interactive dramas take place in virtual worlds inhabited by believable agents with whom an audience interacts. In the course of this interaction, the audience experiences a story. This paper presents the research philosophy behind the Oz Project, a research group at CMU that has spent the last ten years studying believable agents and interactive drama. The paper then surveys current work from an Oz perspective.

#!Intelligent mobile robots need the ability to integrate robust navigation facilities with higher level reasoning. This paper is an attempt at combining results and techniques from the areas of robot navigation and of intelligent agency. We propose to integrate an existing navigation system based on fuzzy logic with a deliberator based on the so-called BDI model. We discuss some of the subtleties involved in this integration, and illustrate it on a simulated example. Experiments on a real mobile robot are under way.

#!Integrated project management means that design and construction planning are interleaved with plan execution, allowing both the design and plan to be changed as necessary. This requires that the right effects of change need to be propagated through the plan and design. When this is distributed among designers and planners, no one may have all of the information to perform such propagation and it is important to identify what effects should be propagated to whom, and when. We describe a set of dependencies among plan and design elements that allow such notification by a set of message-passing software agents. The result is to provide a novel level of computer support for complex projects.

#!Inspired by legal reasoning, this paper presents an argument-based system for defeasible reasoning, with a logic-programming-like language, and based on Dung's argumentation-theoretic approach to the semantics of logic programming. The language of the system has both weak and explicit negation, and conflicts between arguments are decided with the help of priorities on the rules. These priorities are not fixed, but are themselves defeasibly derived as conclusions within the system.

#!Autonomous robots need the ability to move purposefully and without human intervention in real-world environments that have not been specifically engineered for them. These environments are characterized by the pervasive presence of uncertainty: the need to cope with this uncertainty constitutes a major challenge for autonomous robots. In this note, we discuss this challenge, and present some specific solutions based on our experience on the use of fuzzy logic in mobile robots. We focus on three issues: how to realize robust motion control; how to flexibly execute navigation plans; and how to approximately estimate the robot's location.

#!This article presents the event calculus, a logic-based formalism for representing actions and their effects. A circumscriptive solution to the frame problem is deployed which reduces to monotonic predicate completion. Using a number of benchmark examples from the literature, the formalism is shown to apply to a variety of domains, including those featuring actions with indirect effects, actions with nondeterministic effects, concurrent actions, and continuous change.

#!After reviewing a number of Internet tools and technologies originating in the field of logic programming and discussing promissing directions of ongoing research, we describe a logic programming based networking infrastructure which combines reasoning and knowledge processing with flexible coordination of dynamic state changes and computation mobility, as well as and its use for the design of intelligent mobile agent programs. A lightweight logic programming language, Jinni, implemented in Java is introduced as a flexible scripting tool for gluing together knowledge processing components and Java objects in networked client/server applications and thin client environments as well as through applets over the Web. Mobile threads, implemented by capturing first order continuations in a compact data structure sent over the network, allow Jinni to interoperate with remote high performance BinProlog servers for CPU-intensive knowledge processing. A Controlled Natural Language to Prolog translator with support of third party speech recognition and text-to-speech translation allows interaction with users not familiar with logic programming.

We present current research developments in the Virtual Life of autonomous synthetic actors. After a brief description of our geometric. physical, and auditory Virtual Environments, we introduce the perception action principles with a few simple examples. We emphasize the concept of virtual sensors for virtual humans. In particular, we describe our experiences in implementing virtual sensors such as vision sensors, tactile sensors, and hearing sensors. We then describe knowledge-based navigation. knowledge-based locomotion and in more details sensor-based tennis.

#!Dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) extend Bayesian networks from static domains to dynamic domains. The only known generic method for exact inference in DBNs is based on dynamic expansion and reduction of active slices. It is effective when the domain evolves relatively slowly, but is reported to be "too expensive" for fast evolving domain where inference is under time pressure. This study explores the stationary feature of problem domains to improve the efficiency of exact inference in DBNs. We propose the construction of a temporally invariant template of a DBN directly supporting exact inference and discuss issues in the construction. This method eliminates the need for the computation associated with dynamic expansion and reduction of the existing method. The method is demonstrated by experimental result.

The book studies structures with incomplete information from the logical, algebraic and computational perspective. The formalisms developed are non-invasive in that only the actual information is needed in the process of analysis without external sources of information being required. The book is intended for researchers, lecturers and graduate students who wish to get acquainted with the rough set style approach to information systems with incomplete information.

#!Web mining aims to discover useful information and knowledge from the Web hyperlink structure, page contents, and usage data. Although Web mining uses many conventional data mining techniques, it is not purely an application of traditional data mining due to the semistructured and unstructured nature of the Web data and its heterogeneity. It has also developed many of its own algorithms and techniques. Liu has written a comprehensive text on Web data mining. Key topics of structure mining, content mining, and usage mining are covered both in breadth and in depth. His book brings together all the essential concepts and algorithms from related areas such as data mining, machine learning, and text processing to form an authoritative and coherent text. The book offers a rich blend of theory and practice, addressing seminal research ideas, as well as examining the technology from a practical point of view. It is suitable for students, researchers and practitioners interested in Web mining both as a learning text and a reference book. Lecturers can readily use it for classes on data mining, Web mining, and Web search. Additional teaching materials such as lecture slides, datasets, and implemented algorithms are available online.

#!It is well known that equality sets between two morphisms possess a remarkable generative capacity: an arbitrary recursively enumerable set is obtained from an equality set by certain simple operations. Interconnections between simplicity of computations and structural primitivity of words in equality sets have also been observed. The paper discusses recent work in this area, pointing out certain open problems and emphasizing new directions for research.

#!We present a new reliable dense disparity estimation algorithm which employs Gaussian scale-space with anisotropic disparity-field diffusion. This algorithm estimates edge-preserving dense disparity vectors using a diffusive method on iteratively Gaussian-filtered images with a scale, i.e. the Gaussian scalespace. While a Gaussian filter kernel generates a coarser resolution from stereo image pairs, only strong and meaningful boundaries are adaptively selected on the resolution of the filtered images. Then, coarse global disparity vectors are initialized using the boundary constraint. The per-pixel disparity vectors are iteratively obtained by the local adjustment of the global disparity vectors using an energy-minimization framework. The proposed algorithm preserves the boundaries while inner regions are smoothed using anisotropic disparity-field diffusion. In this work, the Gaussian scale-space efficiently avoids illegal matching on a large baseline by the restriction of the range. Moreover, it prevents the computation from iterating into local minima of ill-posed diffusion on large gradient areas e.g. shadow and texture region, etc. The experimental results prove the excellent localization performance preserving the disparity discontinuity of each object.

#!A registration method is proposed for 3D reconstruction of an indoor environment using a multi-view camera. In general, previous methods have a high computational complexity and are not robust for 3D point cloud with low precision. Thus, a projection-based registration is presented. First, depth are refined based on temporal property by excluding 3D points with a large variation, and spatial property by filling holes referring neighboring 3D points. Second, 3D point clouds acquired at two views are projected onto the same image plane, and two-step integer mapping enables the modified KLT to find correspondences. Then, fine registration is carried out by minimizing distance errors. Finally, a final color is evaluated using colors of corresponding points and an indoor environment is reconstructed by applying the above procedure to consecutive scenes. The proposed method reduces computational complexity by searching for correspondences within an image plane. It not only enables an effective registration even for 3D point cloud with low precision, but also need only a few views. The generated model can be adopted for interaction with as well as navigation in a virtual environment.

#!This paper addresses the following version of the multiple range scan registration problem. A scanner with an associated intensity camera is placed at a series of locations throughout a large environment; scans are acquired at each location. The problem is to decide automatically which scans overlap and to estimate the parameters of the transformations aligning these scans. Our technique is based on (1) detecting and matching keypoints ¿ distinctive locations in range and intensity images, (2) generating andrefining a transformation estimate from each keypoint match, and (3) deciding if a given refined estimate is correct. While these steps are familiar, we present novel approaches to each. A new range keypoint technique is presented that uses spin images to describe holes in smooth surfaces. Intensity keypoints are detected using multiscale filters, described using intensity gradient histograms, and backprojected to form 3D keypoints. A hypothesized transformation is generated by matching a single keypoint from one scan to a single keypoint from another, and is refined using a robust form of the ICP algorithm in combination with controlled region growing. Deciding whether a refined transformation is correct is based on three criteria: alignment accuracy, visibility, and a novel randomness measure. Together these three steps produce good results in test scans of the Rensselaer campus.

#!Most research on 3-D object classification and recognition focuses on recognition of objects in 3-D scenes from a small database of known 3-D models. Such an approach does not scale well to large databases of objects and does not generalize well to unknown (but similar) object classification. This paper presents two ideas to address these problems (i) class selection, i.e., grouping similar objects into classes (ii) class prototyping, i.e., exploiting common structure within classes to represent the classes. At run time matching a query against the prototypes is sufficient for classification. This approach will not only reduce the retrieval time but also will help increase the generalizing power of theclassification algorithm. Objects are segmented into classes automatically using an agglomerative clustering algorithm. Prototypes from these classes are extracted using one of three class prototyping algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the two steps in speeding up the classification process without sacrificing accuracy.

#!Accurate local surface geometry estimation in discrete surfaces is an important problem with numerous applications. Principal curvatures and principal directions can be used in applications such as shape analysis and recognition, object segmentation, adaptive smoothing, anisotropic fairing of irregular meshes, and anisotropic texture mapping. In this paper, a novel approach for accurate principal direction estimation in discrete surfaces is described. The proposed approach is based on local directional curve sampling of the surface where the sampling frequency can be controlled. This local model has a large number of degrees of freedoms compared with known techniques and so can better represent the local geometry. The proposed approach is quantitatively evaluated and compared with known techniques for principal direction estimation. In order to perform an unbiased evaluation in which smoothing effects are factored out, we use a set of randomly generated Bezier surface patches for which the principal directions can be computed analytically.

#!This paper proposes a method for modeling 3D face from the 2D facial images captured from the surrounding 2D cameras by which the color texture and surface shape information of the face are synchronously measured. And 3D facial caricaturing method is proposed by using the 3D(the polygon data) face model. Automatic method for extracting regions of the facial parts is technically proposed, and the feature points are extracted from those regions. We propose the mesh model composed of 44 feature points and 82 meshes to cover a head. To generate the caricature from this polygon data, the individuality feature is defined in value by the difference of the feature points between the input face and the mean face, which was defined from the average of many input faces.

#index3883
#!In this paper, we propose an uncalibrated, multi-image 3D reconstruction, using coded structured light. Normally, a conventional coded structured light system consists of a camera and a projector and needs precalibration before scanning. Since the camera and the projector have to be fixed after calibration, reconstruction of a wide area of the scene or reducing occlusions by multiple scanning are difficult and sometimes impossible. In the proposed method, multiple scanning while moving the camera or the projector is possible by applying the uncalibrated stereo method, thereby achieving a multi-image 3D reconstruction. As compared to the conventional coded structured light method, our system does not require calibration of extrinsic camera parameters, occlusions are reduced, and a wide area of the scene can be acquired. As compared to image-based multi-image reconstruction, the proposed system can obtain dense shape data with higher precision. As a result of these advantages, users can freely move either the cameras or projectors to scan a wide range of objects, but not if both the camera and the projector are moved at the same time.

#!Many geographically distributed experts in different areas such as medical imaging, e-commerce, and digital museums, are in need of 3D models. Although 3D models are becoming widely available due to the recent technological advancement and modeling tools, we lack a digital library system where they can be searched and retrieved efficiently. In this paper we focus on an efficient discovery service consisting of multi-level hierarchical browsing service that enables users to navigate large sets of 3D models. For this purpose, we use shape based clustering to abstract a large set of 3D models to a small set of representative models (key models). Our service applies clustering recursively to limit the number of key models that a user views at a time. Clustering is derived from metrics that are based on a concept of compression and similarity computation using surface signatures. Signatures are the two-dimensional representations of a 3D model and they can be used to define similarity between 3D models. We integrated the proposed browsing capability with 3DLIB,(a digital library for 3-D models that we are building at Old Dominion University), and evaluated the proposed browsing service using the Princeton Shape Benchmark (PSB). Our evaluation shows significant better precision and recall as compared to other approaches.

One of them is the precise understanding of optical properties of objects, which is possible to obtain from 3D plus brightness or color data. Those properties are usually important inspection criteria; for example, the specular sharpness of a coatted surface is usually related to the coating quality. This paper is related to a procedure for recovering the specular sharpness and other surface-related properties from objects. The current approach works on 3D plus brightness or color data, which are retrieved in two steps using a common structured-light triangulation-based technique and an ordinary non-structured spot light. Some experimental results obtained on industrial parts are also shown.

#!3D interactive modeling from range data aims at simultaneously producing and visualizing the surface model of an object while data is collected. The current research challenge is producing the final result in real-time. Using a recently proposed framework, a surface model is built in a volumetric structure encoding a vector field in the neighborhood of the object surface. In this paper, it is shown that the framework allows one to locally control the model resolution during acquisition. Using ray tracing, efficient visualization approaches of the multiresolution vector field are described and compared. More precisely, it is shown that volume traversal can be optimized while preventing holes and reducing aliasing in the rendered image.

#!Today modeling from reality receives more and more attention. In this paper, we present a novel image-based 3D registration method. Compared with a previous one it does not require accurate starting position, albedo and geometric invariants, but has to address the more apparent mismatch problems. First, distinctive corner points, which act as salient features for subsequent image matching, are detected via the minimal eigenvalue of the auto-correlation matrix. Then, a verification scheme discards the potential mismatches by thresholds of the correlation coefficients and point-to-point distances. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed verification scheme to the previous one using only correlation coefficients under the relaxed conditions.

#!This paper presents a novel approach for view synthesis and image interpolation. The algorithm is build up in a hierarchical way, and this on different structural levels instead of using a classic image pyramid. First coarse matching is done on a ýshape basisý only. A background-foreground segmentation yields a fairly accurate contour for every incoming video stream. Inter-relating these contours is a 1D problem and as such very fast. This step is then used to compute small position dependent bounding-boxes in 3D space which enclose the underlying object. The next step is a more expensive window based matching, within the volume of these bounding-boxes. This is limited to a number of regions around ýpromisingý feature points. Global regularisation is obtained by a graph cut. Speed results here from limiting the number of feature points. In a third step the interpolation is ýpre-renderedý and simultaneously evaluated on a per pixel basis. This is done by computing a Birchfield dissimilarity measure on the GPU. Per pixel parallelised operations keep computational cost low. Finally the bad interpolated parts are ýpatchedý. This per pixel correction yields the final interpolated view at the finest level. Here we will also deal explicitly with opacity at the borders of the foreground object.

#!This paper describes a 3D modeling method for wide area outdoor environments which is based on integrating omnidirectional range and color images. In the proposed method, outdoor scenes can be efficiently digitized by an omnidirectional laser rangefinder which can obtain a 3D shape with high-accuracy and by an omnidirectional multi-camera system (OMS) which can capture a high-resolution color image. Multiple range images are registered by minimizing the distances between corresponding points in the different range images. In order to register multiple range images stably, points on plane portions detected from the range data are used in registration process. The position and orientation acquired by RTK-GPS and gyroscope are used as initial values of simultaneous registration. The 3D model obtained by registration of range data is mapped by textures selected from omnidirectional images in consideration of the resolution of texture and occlusions of the model. In experiments, we have carried out 3D modeling of our campus with the proposed method.

#index3899
#!In this paper we consider one aspect of the problem of automatically building shape models of articulating objects from example range images. Central to the model construction problem is the registration of range data, taken from different vantage points, into a common coordinate frame. This involves determining a transformation for each set of range data which aligns overlapping surface points in the common frame. Current registration algorithms have been developed specifically for rigid objects, but it is not obvious how these can be extended to articulated or more generally deformable objects. Here, we propose that range images of articulated objects are first segmented into their rigid subcomponents. Each subcomponent can then be registered in isolation using the existing algorithms designed specifically for rigid parts and the final model formed by reassembling all of the submodels. This has motivated the development of a rigid part segmentation algorithm which is described and demonstrated here. The algorithm is currently limited to non-umbilic surfaces, but in this more restricted domain is shown to work well.

This technology opens up opportunities to extract new measurements for quantifying the body shape. Using the data from the first large scale 3-D anthropometric survey, the CAESAR project, we demonstrate that the human body shape can be represented by a small number of principal components. Principal Component Analysis extracts orthogonal basis vectors, called eigenpersons, from the space of body shapes. The shape of any individual person can then be expressed by the linear combination of the basis vectors. We demonstrate that some of these components correspond to the commonly used body measurements like height and weight and others indicate new ways of charactering body shape variations. We develop tools to visualize the changes of the body shape along the main components. These tools help understand the meaningful components of the human body shape.

#!In the present paper we introduce a range image sensor, the PSD-chip, designed for sheet of light range imaging. The image sensor consists of an array of 128 Position Sensitive Detector (PSD)-strips with a 20 mm length and a 28 /spl mu/m pitch. Design considerations for the image sensor are discussed, as well as the on-chip electronics. The on-chip electronics consists of an analog part and a digital part. The analog preamplifiers deal with the low-pass filtering of the sensor-signals in order to reduce the noise bandwidth. The digital part consists of an analog current multiplexer, implemented in ECL technology. Our goal is to achieve a 2 MHz range/frequency at 12 bits resolution.

#!We present a real-time correlation-based stereo algorithm with improved accuracy. Encouraged by the success of recent stereo algorithms that aggregate the matching cost based on color segmentation, a novel image-gradient-guided cost aggregation scheme is presented in this paper. The new scheme is designed to fit the architecture of recent graphics processing units (GPUs). As a result, our stereo algorithm can run completely on the graphics board: from rectification, matching cost computation, cost aggregation, to the final disparity selection. Compared with many real-time stereo algorithms that use fixed windows, noticeable accuracy improvement has been obtained without sacrificing realtime performance. In addition, existing global optimization algorithms can also benefit from the new cost aggregation scheme. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated with several widely used stereo datasets and live data captured from a stereo camera.

#!We present in this paper a method to obtain automatically CAD models of industrial pipes from range images. The models are based on two geometric primitives, cylinders and torii, which are enough to represent most parts of the pipes. The images are obtained with an accurate long-distance laser range sensor developed for reverse engineering in industrial structures. The key issue for automatic CAD modeling is the automatic segmentation of the data into subsets of points corresponding to the desired primitives. To do so, we use differential geometry to segment lines of centers of curvature into straight and curved parts, corresponding to the cylinder and torus parts of the original image. Differential geometry results being noisy and biased, we use an optimal approach for the computation of centers of curvature.

#!We present a new method for the global registration of several overlapping 3D surfaces sampled on an object. The method is based on the ICP (iterative closest point) algorithm and on a segmentation of the sampled points in an optimized set of z-buffers. This multi-z-buffer technique provides a 3D space partitioning which greatly accelerates the search of the nearest neighbours in the establishment of the point-to-point correspondence between overlapping surfaces. Then a randomized iterative registration is processed on the surface set. We have tested an implementation of this technique on real sampled surfaces. It appears to be rapid accurate and robust, especially in the case of highly curved objects.

#!This paper describes a 3-D vision system based on a new 3-D sensor technology for the detection and classification of occupants in a car. New generation of so-called "smart airbags" require the information about the occupancy type and position of the occupant. This information allows a distinct control of the airbag inflation. In order to reduce the risk of injuries due to airbag deployment, the airbag can be suppressed completely in case of a child seat oriented in reward direction. In this paper we propose a 3-D vision system based on a 3-D optical time-of-flight (TOF) sensor, for the detection and classification of the occupancy on the passenger seat. Geometrical shape features are extracted from the 3-D image sequences. Polynomialclassifier is considered for the classification task. A comparison of classifier performance with principle components (eigenimages) is presented. This paper also discuss the robustness of the features with variation of the data. The full scale tests have been conducted on a wide range of realistic situations (adults/children/child seats etc.) which may occur in a vehicle.

#!This paper demonstrates the accuracy of a prototype Laser Range Camera (LRC) developed at the National Research Council of Canada for the creation of models of real objects. A laser survey performed in collaboration with the Canadian Space Agency and NASA is used as a test case. The object selected for this particular test case is the Orbiter Docking System (ODS) located at the Kennedy Space Center, Florida. During the laser survey, 128 range (and registered intensity) images were acquired all around the ODS. These images were then processed in our laboratory. A full model of the top portion of the ODS was created along with an almost complete model of the ODS. The ODS has a diameter of 1.6 m and a height of 3.9 m. Targets mounted on the top portion of the ODS were used to assess the accuracy of the calibration and of the image registration process. These targets were measured with a network of theodolites a day prior to the laser survey and used as a reference. With the current calibration and range image registration techniques, an accuracy better than 0.25 mm in X and Y, and, 0.80 mm in Z was achieved. These results compare favorably with the single point accuracy obtained after calibration, i.e., about 0.25 mm in X and Y, and, 0.50 mm in Z. These figures and others should testify on the usefulness of a LRC for accurate model building.

#!A scene analysis system for the 3-D modeling of objects is presented. It combines surface reconstruction techniques with object recognition for the generation of 3-D models for computer graphic applications. The system permits the insertion of highlevel constraints, like a specific angle between two house walls, in an explicit knowledge base implemented as a semantic net. The applicability of those constraints is proved by asserting and testing hypotheses in an interpretation phase. In the case of rejection a more general constraint or model is selected. The capabilities of the system were shown for the modeling of buildings using depth from stereo and contour information. The system reconstructs the surface of the scene objects using the constraints selected in the prior interpretation.

#!This paper describes a new algorithm to segment in continuous parametric regions range images. The algorithm starts with an initial partition of small first order regions using a robust fitting algorithm constrained by the detection of depth and orientation discontinuities. The algorithm then optimally group these regions into larger and larger regions using parametric functions until an approximation limit is reached. The algorithm uses Bayesian decision theory to determine the local optimal grouping and the complexity of the parametric model used to represent the range signal. After the segmentation process an exact description of the boundary of each region is computed from the mutual intersections of the extracted surfaces. Experimental results show significant improvement of region boundary localization. A systematic comparison of our algorithm to the most well known algorithm in the literature is presented to highlight the contributions of this paper.

Through this combination and adaptation of existing completion techniques we are able to achieve realistic, plausible completion of 2½D range captures.

#!Industrial fermentation procedures involve the mixing of multiple phases (solid, liquid, gaseous), where the interfacial area between the phases (air bubbles, oil drops and aqueous medium) determines the nutrients transfer and hence the performance of the culture. Interactions between phases occur, giving rise to the formation of complex structures containing air bubbles and small drops from the aqueous phase, trapped in oil drops (water-in-oil-in-water). A two-dimensional observation of this phenomenon may lead to an erroneous determination of the phenomena occurring since bubbles and droplets coming from different focal planes may appear overlapped. In the present work, an original strategy to solve this problem is described. Micro-stereoscopic on-line image acquisition techniques have been used, so as to obtain accurate images from the cultures for further three-dimensional analysis. Using this methodology, the three-dimensional spatial position of the trapped bubbles and droplets moving at high speed can be calculated in order to determine their relative concentration. To evaluate the accuracy of this technique, the results obtained with our system have been compared with those obtained by an expert. An agreement of 95% was achieved. Also, this technique was able to evaluate 14% more bubbles and droplets corresponding to overlaps that the expert was not able to discern in non-stereoscopic images.

#!This paper presents a system for fully automatic recognition and reconstruction of 3D objects in image databases. We pose the object recognition problem as one of finding consistent matches between all images, subject to the constraint that the images were taken from a perspective camera. We assume that the objects or scenes are rigid. For each image we associate a camera matrix, which is parameterised by rotation, translation and focal length. We use invariant local features to find matches between all images, and the RANSAC algorithm to find those that are consistent with the fundamental matrix. Objects are recognised as subsets of matching images. We then solve for the structure and motion of each object, using a sparse bundle adjustment algorithm. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to recognise and reconstruct 3D objects from an unordered image database with no user input at all.

#!Advancements in technology for digitizing the surface of the human body are providing new opportunities for research in engineering anthropometry, the study of human body measurement for design and evaluation purposes. The availability of the technology is just the first step in applying surface scanning to engineering anthropometry; several issues remain to be resolved to make these tools useful for engineering applications. One important issue is the standardization of positioning and the posture of the subject for scanning. In engineering it is not enough to be able to measure one individual one time in one posture, but it is also necessary to measure the individual in different postures and compare the individual with many other people who have been comparably measured. Not surprisingly, people can be more difficult to measure precisely than fixed stationary objects. In the process of developing standardized procedures for surveying the civilian populations of North America and Europe, an experiment was conducted to determine optimal scanning positions. While this experiment used just one type of scanning technology, many of the methods are transferable to other methods as well. This paper discusses the results from that investigation.

#!This paper describes 3D acquisition and modeling of the "Plastico di Roma antica", a large plaster-of-Paris model of imperial Rome (16x17 meters) created in the last century. Its overall size demands an acquisition approach typical of large structures, but it is also characterized by extremely tiny details, typical of small objects: houses are a few centimeters high; their doors, windows, etc. are smaller than 1 cm. The approach followed to resolve this "contradiction" is described. The result is a huge but precise 3D model created by using a special metrology Laser Radar. We give an account of the procedures of reorienting the large point clouds obtained after each acquisition step (50-60 million points) into a single reference system by means of measuring fixed redundant reference points. Finally we show how the data set can be properly divided into 2x2 meters sub-areas for allowing data merging and mesh editing..

#!This work is motivated by the desire of exploiting for 3D registration purposes the photometric information current range cameras typically associate to range data. Automatic pairwise 3D registration procedures are two steps procedures with the first step performing an automatic crude estimate of the rigid motion parameters and the second step refining them by the ICP algorithm or some of its variations. Methods for efficiently implementing the first crude automatic estimate are still an open research area. Spin-images are a 3D matching tecnique very effective in this task. Since spin-images solely exploit geometry information it appears natural to extend their original definition to include texture information. Such an operation can clearly be made in many ways. This work introduces one particular extension of spin-images, called textured spin-images, and demostrates its performance for 3D registration. It will be seen that textured spin-images enjoy remarkable properties since they can give rigid motion estimates more robust, more precise, more resilient to noise than standard spin-images at a lower computational cost.

#!We investigate the possibility of Euclidean reconstruction from translational motion, using multiple uncalibrated cameras. We show that in the case of multiple cameras viewing a translating scene, no additional constraints are given by the translational motion compared to the more general case with one camera viewing a scene undergoing a general motion. However, the knowledge of translational motion allows an intermediate affine reconstruction from each camera, and aids in the reconstruction process by simplifying several steps, resulting in a more reliable algorithm for 3D reconstruction. We also identify the critical directions of translation, for which no affine reconstruction is possible. Experiments on real and simulated data are performed to illustrate that the method works in practice.

A weighted averaging method is then used to extract a panoramic texture map from the input images. To recover the hairstyle of the specified person, a virtual photo plane is defined, according to a corresponding true photo plane, on which one input image is recorded. It provides hints to compute the 3D positions of the visual contour points of the hair from the images taken at different viewpoints. Finally, more hairs are grown to cover the whole region of the scalp using an interpolation method on the 3D scalp mesh surfaces.

#!This paper presents a hybrid approach to the segmentation of range images into planar regions. The term hybrid refers to a combination of edge- and region-based considerations. A reliable computational procedure which takes the range image discontinuities into account is presented for computing the pixel's normal. The segmentation algorithm consists of two parts. In the first one, the pixels are aggregated according to local properties derived from the input data and are represented by a region adjacency graph (RAG). At this stage, the image is still over-segmented. In the second part, the segmentation is refined thanks to the construction of an irregular pyramid. The base of the pyramid is the RAG previously extracted. The over-segmented regions are merged using a surface-based description. This algorithm has been evaluated on 80 real images acquired by two different range sensors using the methodology proposed in (Hoover et al., 1996). Experimental results are presented and compared to others obtained by four research groups.

#!Geometric fusion of multiple sets of overlapping surface measurements is an important problem for complete 3D object or environment modelling. Fusion based on a discrete implicit surface representation enables fast reconstruction for complex object modelling. However, surfaces are represented at a single resolution resulting in impractical storage costs for accurate reconstruction of large objects. This paper addresses accurate reconstruction of surface models independent of object size. An incremental algorithm is presented for implicit surface representation of an arbitrary triangulated mesh in a volumetric envelope around the surface. A hierarchical volumetric structure is introduced for efficient representation by local approximation of the surface within a fixed error bound using the maximum voxel size. Multi-resolution geometric fusion is achieved by incrementally constructing a hierarchical surface representation with bounded error. Results are presented for validation of the multi-resolution representation accuracy and reconstruction of real objects. Multi-resolution geometric fusion achieves a significant reduction in representation cost for the same level of geometric accuracy.

#!This paper describes a novel method for digitizing the 3D shape of an object in real-time, which can be used for capturing live sequence of the 3D shape of moving or deformable objects such as faces. Two DMD (= Digital Micro Mirror) devices are used as high speed switches for modulating and demodulating light rays. One DMD is used to generate rays of light pulses, which are projected onto the object to be measured. Another DMD is used to demodulate the light reflected from the object illuminated by the light pulses into intensity image that describes the disparity. A prototype range finder implementing the proposed method has been built. The experimental results showed that the proposed method works and video sequences of disparity images can be captured in real time.

Intuitively appealing suboptimal solutions derived from the family of K dimensional space-filling Hilbert curves are obtained. Preliminary experimental results are presented.

#!Reliable understanding of the 3D driving environment is vital for obstacle detection and Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) applications. Laser or millimeter wave radars have shown good performance in measuring relative speed and distance in a highway driving environment. However the accuracy of these systems decreases in an urban traffic environment as more confusion occurs due to factors such as parked vehicles, guardrails, poles and motorcycles. A stereovision based sensing system provides an effective supplement to radar-based road scene analysis with its much wider field of view and more accurate lateral information. This paper presents an efficient solution using a stereovision based road scene analysis algorithm which employs the "U-V-disparity" concept. This concept is used to classify a 3D road scene into relative surface planes and characterize the features of road pavement surfaces, roadside structures and obstacles. Real-time implementation of the disparity map calculation and the "U-V-disparity" classification is also presented.

#!This paper describes how to automatically extract the presence and location of geometrical irregularities on a surface of revolution. To this end a partial 3D scan of the workpiece under consideration is acquired by structured light ranging. The application we focus on is the detection and removal of burrs on industrial workpieces. Cylindrical metallic objects will cause a strong specular reflection in every direction. These highlights are compensated for in the projected patterns, hence ýadaptive 3D scanningý. The triangular mesh produced is then used to identify the axis and generatrix of the corresponding surface of revolution. The search space for finding this axis is four dimensional: a valid choice of parameters is two orientation angles (as in spherical coordinates) and the 2D intersection point with the plane spanned by two out of three axis of the local coordinate system. For finding the axis we test the circularity of the planar intersections of the mesh in different directions, using statistical estimation methods to deal with noise. Finally the ýidealý generatrix derived from the scan data is compared to the real surface topology. The difference will identify the burr. The algorithm is demonstrated on a metal wheel that has burrs on both sides. Visual servoing of a robotic arm based on this detection is work in progress.

#!Most three-dimensional acquisition systems generate several partial reconstructions that have to be registered and integrated for building a complete 3D model. In this paper, we propose a volumetric shape integration method, consisting of weighted signed distance functions represented as variational implicit functions (VIF) or surfaces (VIS). Texture integration is solved similarly by using three weighted color functions also based on VIFs. Using these continuous (not grid-based) representations solves current limitations of volumetric methods: no memory inefficient and resolution limiting grid representation is required. The built-in smoothing properties of the VIS representations also improve the robustness of the final integration against noise in the input data. Experimental results are performed on real-live, noiseless and noisy synthetic data of human faces in order to show the robustness and accuracy of the integration algorithm.

#!Three-dimensional models are often assembled from several partial reconstructions from unknown viewpoints. In order to provide a fully automatic, robust and accurate method for aligning and integrating partial reconstructions without any prior knowledge of the relative viewpoints of the sensor or the geometry of the imaging process, we propose a 4-step registration and integration algorithm based on a common Variational Implicit Surface (VIS) representation of the partial surface reconstructions. First, a global crude registration without a priori knowledge is performed followed by a pose refinement of partial reconstruction pairs. Pair-wise registrations are converted into a multi-view registration, before a final integration of the reconstructions into one entity or model occurs. Furthermore, making use of the smoothing properties of the VIS representations, the algorithm proves to be robust against noise in the reconstruction data. Experimental results on real-live, as well as noiseless and noisy simulated data are presented to show the feasibility, the accuracy and robustness of our registration scheme.

#!Multiperspective imaging has been used to recover the structure of a scene. Although several algorithms for structure recovery have been developed as typified by stereo panoramas, there exists no common framework which subsumes various camera motions to capture stereo images. This paper presents a framework for stereo by multiperspective imaging, which is general in that it can handle 6 degree-of-freedom (DOF) camera motion. We derive geometric constraints, equation for structure recovery and that for an epipolar curve by modeling the acquisition of stereo images using push-broom cameras (line sensors). We consider a class of camera motion called a vertical view plane class and demonstrate that several previous results are really special cases of our results. Numerical examples are given to show the correctness of the derived equations.

#!We consider the problem of geometric integration and representation of multiple views of non-rigidly deforming 3D surface geometry captured at video rate. Instead of treating each frame as a separate mesh we present a representation which takes into consideration temporal and spatial coherence in the data where possible. We first segment gross base transformations using correspondence based on a closest point metric and represent these motions as piecewise rigid transformations. The remaining residual is encoded as displacement maps at each frame giving a displacement video. At both these stages occlusions and missing data are interpolated to give a representation which is continuous in space and time. We demonstrate the integration of multiple views for four different non-rigidly deforming scenes: hand, face, cloth and a composite scene. The approach achieves the integration of multiple-view data at different times into one representation which can processed and edited.

#!This paper presents a fast pose estimation algorithm of a 3D free form object in 2D images using 2D distance maps. One of the popular techniques of the pose estimation of 3D object in 2D image is the point-based method such as the ICP algorithm. However, the calculation cost for determining point correspondences is expensive. To overcome this problem, the proposed method utilizes a distance map on the 2D image plane, which is constructed quite rapidly by the Fast Marching Method. For pose estimation of the object, contour lines of the 2D image and the projection of the 3D object are aligned using the distance map iteratively by the robust M-estimator. Some experimental results with simulated models and actual images of the endoscopic operation are successfully carried out.

#!Existing techniques for view-based 3-D object recognition using computer vision rely on training the system on a particular object before it is introduced into an environment. This training often consists of taking over 100 images at predetermined points around the viewing sphere in an attempt to account for most angles for viewing the object. However, in many circumstances, the environment is well known and we only expect to see a small subset of all possible appearances. In this paper, we will test the idea that under these conditions, it is possible to train an object recognition system on-the-fly using images of an object as it appears in its environment, with supervision from the user. Furthermore, because some views of an object are much more likely than others, the number of training images required can be greatly reduced.

The second one offers an approximate solution but can be used in a dynamic environment for guiding selective range measurements and simplifies the calibration process. The error introduced by this approximation has been derived as a function of the distance to the object and geometry of the set-up. Results of combining range information from a laser camera and colour camera are presented.

#!Before surface mount components can be placed on a circuit board, it is necessary to print solder paste onto pads. The paste is then melted to make an electrical connection (reflow). A screen printing process is used to print the solder paste onto the board. This is a complicated process with a large number of input parameters. Some of these parameters can be controlled and it is the purpose of this work to investigate control of the process based on measurement of the output shape of the printed paste. The shape is measured using a laser range scanner Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is proposed as a tool for describing solder paste shape with a small number of parameters. This paper discusses the use of PCA for shape analysis in range images as well as explaining how such a description can be incorporated into a process control loop.

#!Many optimization processes encounter a problem inefficiently reaching a global minimum or a near global minimum. Traditional methods such as Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and trust-region method face the problems of dropping into local minima as well. On the other hand, some algorithms such as simulated annealing and genetic algorithm try to find a global minimum but they are mostly time-consuming. Without a good initialization, many optimization methods are unable to guarantee a global minimum result. We address a novel method in 3D circle and ellipse fitting, which alleviates the optimization problem. It can not only increase the probability of getting in global minima but also reduce the computation time. Based on our previous work, we decompose the parameters into two parts: one part of parameters can be solved by an analytic or a direct method and another part has to be solved by an iterative procedure. Via this scheme, the topography of optimization space is simplified and therefore we reduce the number of local minima and the computation time. We experimentally compare our method with the traditional ones and show superior performance.

#!Movement artifacts during whole body scanning are a major concern when reproducible results are required. To determine the magnitude of the artifacts, 11 subjects were scanned with and without a positioning device on the head. The sway of the body was determined by a force plate. It was shown that the pointer on the head reduced the magnitude of the forward/backward sway by over 50%. The resulting standard deviation is less than the resolution of the scanner. Movement artifacts within the body, like head rotation, are hard to control. Again, the pointer on the head assists in reducing the artifacts. The ventilation depth during the scan determines the shape of the chest and should be standardized to get reproducible results.

The representation comprises descriptive images associated with oriented points on the surface of an object. Constructed using single point bases, these images are data level shape descriptions that are used for efficient matching of oriented points. Correlation of images is used to establish point correspondences between two views; from these correspondences a rigid transformation that aligns the views is calculated. The transformation is then refined and verified using a modified iterative closest point algorithm. To demonstrate the generality of our approach, we present results from multiple sensing domains.

#!In general, multiple views are required to create a complete 3-D model of an object or of a multi-roomed indoor scene. In this work, we address the problem of merging multiple textured 3-D data sets, each of which corresponds to a different view of a scene or object. There are two steps to the merging process: registration and integration. To register, or align, data sets we use a modified version of the Iterative Closest Point algorithm; our version, which we call color ICP, considers not only 3-D information, but color as well. We show that the use of color decreases registration error by an order of magnitude. Once the 3-D data sets have been registered we integrate them to produce a seamless, composite 3-D textured model. Our approach to integration uses a 3-D occupancy grid to represent likelihood of spatial occupancy through voting. In addition to occupancy information, we store surface normal in each voxel of the occupancy grid. Surface normal is used to robustly extract a surface from the occupancy grid; on that surface we blend textures from multiple views.

Because of their small field of view, such sensors navigate closely to the digitized object and are subject to collisions. Unlike previous techniques that addressed only the exhaustiveness of digitization, this work focuses on collision avoidance. To safely identify empty space, shadow and occlusion phenomena are carefully analyzed, and so is the effect of sampling. Then, the planning problem is solved using a hierarchical approach. At low level, we digitize a single view and address collision avoidance using path planning techniques. At high level, the problem becomes the choice of the next best view. Some implementation details and experimental results are presented.

Our approach is based on iterative dynamic programming and computes simultaneously disparity and camera visibility. Interestingly, dynamic programming makes it possible to compute exactly part of the visibility information. The remainder is obtained through heuristics. The validity of our scheme is established using real imagery with ground truth and compares favorably with otherstate-of-the-art multi-baseline stereo algorithms.

#!The paper presents an approach for building 3-D city models for virtual environments from multiple 3-D data sets acquired from different viewpoints by light striping. The raw data sets are represented as single valued parametric surfaces called the 3-D profile maps. The profile maps are registered to the same coordinate system by an iterative surface matching algorithm developed previously. The registration proceeds hierarchically from low to high resolution and all the data sets are matched simultaneously but an initial registration is assumed to be known. After having segmented each map by a region growing algorithm, the maps are integrated into a piecewise planar surface model by merging compatible segments in the overlapping areas. The borders of the segments are also traced an the parametric domains of the maps as a step for building a wireframe model. Test results are shown in the case of a scale model of an urban area digitized in laboratory conditions.

A necessary condition to obtain good results is to accurately calibrate the telemetric and photographic sensors together. We present a study of this calibration process and propose an improved extrinsic calibration technique. It is based on an existing technique which consists in scanning a planar pattern in several poses, giving a set of relative position and orientation constraints. The innovation is the use of a more appropriate laser beam distance between telemetric points and the planar target. Moreover, we use robust methods to manage outliers at several steps of the algorithm. Improved results on both theoretical and experimental data are given.

Rotation invariant features are derived from the coefficients of these transforms. Furthermore we compare two different voxel representations, namely, binary denoting object and background space, and continuous after distance transformation. In the binary voxel representation the voxel values are simply set to 1 on the surface of the object and 0 elsewhere. In the continuous-valued representation the space is filled with a function of distance transform. The rotation invariance properties of the DFT and RCT schemes are analyzed. We have conducted retrieval experiments on the Princeton Shape Benchmark and investigated the retrieval performance of the methods using several quality measures.

#!In this paper, we present a new approach to high quality 3D object reconstruction. Starting from a calibrated sequence of color images, the algorithm is able to reconstruct both the 3D geometry and the texture. The core of the method is based on a deformable model, which defines the framework where texture and silhouette information can be fused. This is achieved by defining two external forces based on the images: a texture driven force and a silhouette driven force. The texture force is computed in two steps: a multi-stereo correlation voting approach and a gradient vector flow diffusion. Due to the high resolution of the voting approach, a multi-grid version of the gradient vector flow has been developed. Concerning the silhouette force, a new formulation of the silhouette constraint is derived. It provides a robust way to integrate the silhouettes in the evolution algorithm. As a consequence, we are able to recover the contour generators of the model at the end of the iteration process. Finally, a texture map is computed from the original images for the reconstructed 3D model.

#!Constructing a full CAD model of a part requires feature descriptions from all sides; in this case we consider surface patches as the geometric primitives. Most previous research in surface patch extraction has concentrated on extracting patches from a single view. This leads to several problems with aligning and combining partial patch fragments in order to produce complete part models. We have avoided these problems by adapting our single view, range data segmentation program to extract patches, and thus models, directly from fully merged range datasets.

#!A novel method is proposed for virtual view generation of traditional dances. In the proposed framework, a traditional dance is captured separately for appearance registration and motion registration. By coordinating the appearance and motion data, we can easily control virtual camera motion within a dancer-centered coordinate system. For this purpose, a coordination problem should be solved between the appearance and motion data, since they are captured separately and the dancer moves freely in the room. The present paper shows a practical algorithm to solve it. A set of algorithms are also provided for appearance and motion registration, and virtual view generation from archived data. In the appearance registration, a 3D human shape is recovered in each time from a set of input images after suppressing their backgrounds. By combining the recovered 3D shape and a set of images for each time, we can compose archived dance data. In the motion registration, stereoscopic tracking is accomplished for color markers placed on the dancer. A virtual view generation is formalized as a color blending among multiple views, and a novel and efficient algorithm is proposed for the composition of a natural virtual view from a set of images. In the proposed method, weightings of the linear combination are calculated from both an assumed viewpoint and a surface normal.

#!This paper presents techniques for the merging of 3D Data coming from different sensors, such as ground and aerial laser range scans. The 3D Models created are reconstructed to give a photo-realistic scene enabling interactive virtual walkthroughs, measurements and scene change analysis. The reconstructed model is based on a weighted integration of all available data based on sensor-specific parameters such as noise level, accuracy, inclination and reflectivity of the target, spatial distribution of points. The geometry is robustly reconstructed with a volumetric approach. Once registered and weighed, all data is re-sampled in a multi-resolution distance field usingout-of-core techniques. The final mesh is extracted by contouring the iso-surface with a feature preserving dual contouring algorithm. The paper shows results of the above technique applied to Verona (Italy) city centre.

#!We give a formal definition of geometric fitting in a way that suits computer vision applications. We point out that the performance of geometric fitting should be evaluated in the limit of small noise rather than in the limit of a large number of data as recommended in the statistical literature. Taking the KCR lower bound as an optimality requirement and focusing on the linearized constraint case, we compare the accuracy of Kanataniýs renormalization with maximum likelihood (ML) approaches including the FNS of Chojnacki et al. and the HEIV of Leedan and Meer. Our analysis reveals the existence of a method superior to all these.

#!Three-dimensional ladar data are commonly used to perform scene understanding for outdoor mobile robots, specifically in natural terrain. One effective method is to classify points using features based on local point cloud distribution into surfaces, linear structures or clutter volumes. But the local features are computed using 3-D points within a support-volume. Local and global point density variations and the presence of multiple manifolds make the problem of selecting the size of this support volume, or scale, challenging. In this paper we adopt an approach inspired by recent developments in computational geometry [5] and investigate the problem of automatic data-driven scale selection to improve point cloud classification. The approach is validated with results using data from different sensors in various environments classified into different terrain types (vegetation, solid surface and linear structure)¹.

#!In this paper we present a new framework for subdivision surface fitting of arbitrary surfaces (not closed objects) represented by polygonal meshes. Our approach is particularly suited for output surfaces from a mechanical or CAD object segmentation for a piecewise subdivision surface approximation. Our algorithm produces a mixed quadrangle-triangle control mesh, near optimal in terms of face and vertex numbers while remaining independent of the connectivity of the input mesh. The first step approximates the boundaries with subdivision curves and creates an initial subdivision surface by optimally linking the boundary control points with respect to the lines of curvature of the target surface. Then, a second step optimizes the initial control polyhedron by iteratively moving control points and enriching regions according to the error distribution. Experiments conducted on several surfaces and on a whole segmented mechanical object, have proven the coherency and theefficiency of our algorithm, compared with existing methods.

#!In this paper, we propose an efficient approximation algorithm using multilevel B-splines based on quasi-interpolants. Multilevel technique uses a coarse to fine hierarchy to generate a sequence of bicubic B-spline functions whose sum approaches the desired interpolation function. To compute a set of control points, quasi-interpolants gives a procedure for deriving local spline approximation methods where a B-spline coefficient only depends on data points taken from the neighborhood of the support corresponding the B-spline. Experimental results show that the smooth surface reconstruction with high accuracy can be obtained from a selected set of scattered or dense irregular samples.

#!While most of the existing range image registration algorithms either have to extract and match structural (geometric or optical) features or have to estimate the motion parameters of interest from outliers corrupted point correspondence data for the elimination of false matches in the process of image registration, the registration error and the collinearity error derived directly from the traditional closest point criterion are also capable of doing the same job. However, the latter has an advantage of easy implementation. The purpose of this paper is to investigate which definition of collinearity is more accurate and stable in eliminating false matches inevitably introduced by the closest point criterion. The experiments based on real images show the advantages and disadvantages of different definitions of collinearity.

#!The computational cost of a collision detection (CD) algorithm on polygonal surfaces depends highly on the complexity of the models. A novel "locally refined" approach is introduced in this paper for fast CD in haptic rendering applications, e.g. haptic surgery and haptic sculpture simulations. Exact interference detections are performed on proposed locally refined meshes, which are in multi-resolution representation. The meshes are generated using mesh simplification and space partition. A new BVH algorithm called "Active Bounding Tree", or AB-Tree, handling collision queries is introduced. At runtime the meshes are dynamically refined to higher resolution in areas that are most likely to collide with other objects. The algorithms are successfully demonstrated in an interactive haptic environment. Compared to existing CD algorithms on single resolution models, noticeable performance improvement has been observed in terms of the precision of collision queries, frame rate, and memory usage.

#!In this paper we present an adaptive Dandelion Model for reconstructing spherical terrain-like Visual Hull (VH) surfaces. The Dandelion Model represents a solid by a pencil of organized line segments emitted from a common point. The directions and the topology of the line segments are derived from the triangle facets of a geodesic sphere, which are recursively subdivided until the desired precision is achieved. The initial lines are cut by silhouettes in 2D and then lifted back to 3D to determine the ending points of the line segments defining sampling points on the spherical terrain-like VH surface. A mesh model can be easily constructed from the Dandelion Model. Our algorithm has the advantages of controllable precision, adaptive resolution, simplicity and speediness. We validate our algorithm by theories and experiments.

#!Video-rate registered range and intensity data are at reach of current sensor technology. This wealth of data can be profitably exploited in order to estimate rigid motion parameters as the approaches to 3-D motion estimation, based on the optical flow of both types of data, indicate. This work introduces an alternative for 3-D motion estimation based on the Fourier transform of the 3-D intensity function implicitly described by the registered time-sequences of range and intensity data. The proposed procedure can lead to an unsupervised method for 3-D rigid motion estimation. This method has several advantages related to the fact that it uses the total available information and not sets of features. With respect to memory occupancy the use of a time-sequence of a 3-D intensity function represents a considerable data reduction with respect to a pair of time-sequences of 2-D functions. The proposed technique, which extends to the 3-D case previous frequency domain estimation algorithms developed for the planar case, retain their robustness.

#!Conventional registration algorithms are mostly concerned with rigid-body transformation parameters between a pair of 3D range images. Our proposed framework aims to determine, in a unified manner, not only such rigid transformation parameters but also various deformation parameters, assuming that the deformation we handle here is strictly defined by some parameterized formulation derived from the deformation mechanism. While conventional registration algorithms usually calcurate six parameters (three translation and three rotation parameters), our proposed algorithm estimates deformation parameters as well. In this paper, we describe how we formulated such an algorithm, implemented it, and evaluated its performance.

The digitizer has the following advantages: 1) compact and inexpensive, 2) skill-free 3D image acquisition, and 3) handles a wide range of objects of various materials. The digitizing algorithm is based on the "Shape-from-Silhouette" framework, where several novel techniques are embedded as follows. In the silhouette extraction, not only pixel-level subtraction between images but also region-level subtraction are embedded so as to achieve precise extraction. The texture acquisition is treated as a labeling problem in an energy minimization framework, which enables us to get realistic textures with a simple operation. Our experiments showed that the digitizing speed of the digitizer was practical.

#!A method for the automatic reconstruction of 3D objects from multiple camera views for 3D multimedia applications is presented. Conventional 3D reconstruction techniques use equipment that restrict the flexibility of the user. In order to increase this flexibility, the presented method is characterized by a simple measurement environment, that consists of a new calibration pattern placed below the object allowing object and pattern acquisition simultaneously. This ensures, that each view can be calibrated individually. From these obtained calibrated camera views, a textured 3D wireframe model is estimated using a shape-from-silhouette approach and texture mapping of the original camera views. Experiments with this system have confirmed a significant gain of flexibility for the user and a drastic reduction of costs for technical equipment while ensuring comparable model quality as conventional reconstruction techniques at the same time.

#!This paper describes a fast and easy-to-use simultaneous alignment method of multiple range images. The most time consuming part of alignment process is searching corresponding points. Although "Inverse calibration" method quickly searches corresponding points in complexity O(n), where n is the number of vertices, the method requires some look-up tables or precise sensorýs parameters. Then, we propose an easy-to-use method that uses "Index Image": "Index image" can be rapidly created using graphics hardware without precise sensorýs parameters. For fast computation of rigid transformation matrices of a large number of range images, we utilized linearized error function and applied incomplete Cholesky conjugate gradient (ICCG) method for solving linear equations. Some experimental results that aligned a large number of range images measured with laser range sensors show the effectiveness of our method.

#!The aperture problem is one of the omnipresent issues in computer vision. Its local character constrains point matching to high textured areas, so that points ingradient- oriented regions (such as straight lines) can not be reliably matched. We propose a new method to overcome this problem by devising a global matching strategy under the factorization framework. We solve the n-frame correspondence problem under this context by assuming the rigidity of the scene. To this end, a geometric contraint is used that selects the matching solution resulting in a rank-4 observation matrix. The rank of the observation matrix is a function of the matching solutions associated to each image and as such a simulteaneous solution for all frames has to be found. An optimization procedure is used in this text in order to find the solution.

#!In this paper, a new adaptive method for Catmull-Clark subdivision is introduced. Adaptive subdivision refines specific areas of a model according to user or application needs. Naive adaptive subdivision algorithm change the connectivity of the mesh, causing geometrical inconsistencies that alter the limit surface. Our method expands the specified region of the mesh such that when it is adaptively subdivided, it produces a smooth surface whose selected area is identical to when the entire mesh is refined. This technique also produces a surface with an increasing level of detail from coarse to fine areas of the surface. We compare our adaptive subdivision with other schemes and present some example applications.

#!This paper presents a simple and efficient method of forming a 3D text label on a 3D triangulated surface. The label is formed by projecting the 2D contours that define the text silhouette onto the triangulated surface, forming 3D contour paths. Surface polygons upon which the 3D contour paths lie are retriangulated using a novel approach that forms a polyline defining the region outside the contour. This algorithm produces labeled 3D surfaces that conform to the specifications of the STL format, making them suitable for fabrication by a rapid prototyping machine. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in forming flat and extruded labels on non-trivial surfaces.

#!This paper presents a new approach for the classification and retrieval of three-dimensional images and models from databases. A set of retrieval algorithms is introduced. These algorithms are content-based, meaning that the input is not made out of keywords but of three-dimensional models. Tensor of inertia, distribution of normals, distribution of cords and multiresolution analysis are used to describe each model. The database can be searched by scale, shape or color or any combination of these parameters. A user friendly interface makes the retrieval operation simple and intuitive and allows to edit reference models according to the specifications of the user. Experimental results using a database of more than 400 range images and 1000 VRML models are presented.

#!Camera calibration methods, whether implicit or explicit, are a critical part of most 3D vision systems. These methods involve estimation of a model for the camera that produced the visual input, and subsequently to infer the 3D structure that gave rise to the input. However, in these systems the error in calibration is typically unknown, or if known, the effect of calibration error on subsequent processing (e.g. 3d reconstruction) is not accounted for. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian camera calibration method that explicitly computes calibration error, and we show how knowledge of this error can be used to improve the accuracy of subsequent processing. What distinguishes the work is the explicit computation of a posterior distribution on unknown camera parameters, rather than just a best estimate. Marginalizing (averaging) subsequent estimates by this posterior is shown to reduce reconstruction error over calibration approaches that rely on a single best estimate. The method is made practical using sampling techniques, that require only the evaluation of the calibration error function and the specification of priors. Samples with their corresponding probability weights can be used to produce better estimates of the camera parameters. Moreover, these samples can be directly used to improve estimates that rely on calibration information, like 3D reconstruction. We evaluate our method using simulated data for a structure from motion problem, in which the same point matches are used to calibrate the camera, estimate the motion, and reconstruct the 3D geometry. Our results show improved reconstruction over non-linear Camera calibration methods like the Maximum Likelihood estimate. Additionally, this approach scales much better in the face of increasingly noisy point matches.

#!Although the iterative closest point algorithm is very effective in registering range data, the quality of registration depends on the geometry of the sampled surfaces. This work presents a registration aid which can greatly reduce the possibility of catastrophic registration failure, increase the quality of registration and register range data which does not overlap. By placing the aid into the scene along with the object(s) of interest, range images taken from any vantage point within the range scanner's workspace can be registered onto a model of the aid and thus into a common reference frame. By considering the causes of registration failure, the surface of the aid is designed so that any range image taken of it from any point in the scanner's workspace will properly register with a model of the aid. The reliability of the aid is demonstrated with a Monte Carlo experiment and its utility is demonstrated with examples from an automated surface acquisition system.

#!Multimedia projectors and cameras make possible the use of structured light to solve problems such as 3D reconstruction, disparity map computation and camera or projector calibration. Each projector displays patterns over a scene viewed by a camera, thereby allowing automatic computation of camera-projector pixel correspondences. This paper introduces a new algorithm to establish this correspondence in difficult cases of image acquisition. A probabilistic model formulated as a Markov Random Field uses the stripe images to find the most likely correspondences in the presence of noise. Our model is specially tailored to handle the unfavorable projector-camera pixel ratios that occur in multiple-projector single-camera setups. For the case where more than one camera is used, we propose a robust approach to establish correspondences between the cameras and compute an accurate disparity map. To conduct experiments, a ground truth was first reconstructed from a high quality acquisition. Various degradations were applied to the pattern images which were then solved using our method. The results were compared to the ground truth for error analysis and showed very good performances, even near depth discontinuities.

In the algorithm, at first, a rough shape model is obtained by shape-from-silhouette method almost automatically. Next, concavities and complex parts on the object surface are obtained by light-sectioning method with manual scanning. For applying light-sectioning method to volume data, we propose volumetric light-sectioning algorithm. Then our modeling system can realize easy and accurate generation of 3D geometric model.

#!Nowadays, with the exponential growing of 3D object representations in private databases or on the web, it is all the more required to match these objects from some views. To improve the results of their matching, we work on the characteristic views of an object. The aim of this study is to find how many characteristic views are required and what relative positions are optimal. This is the reason why the visual hulls are used. From some 2D masks, the nearest possible 3D mesh from the original object is computed. OpenGL views are used to build the visual hulls of 3D models from a given collection and then the distance between the visual hulls and the models are measured thanks to the Hausdorff distance. Then the best view parameters are deduced to reduce the distance. These shots show that three orthogonal views give results very close to the ones given by twelve views on a isocahedron. Some other results on the view resolution and the field of view are discussed.

Consider a pair of cameras that see overlapping parts of the objects. For correct camera poses, the actual image of the overlap area in one camera matches the rendition of the overlap area as seen by the other camera. We define a mismatch score summarizing discrepancies in color, range, and silhouette between pairs of images, and we present an algorithm to efficiently minimize this mismatch score over camera poses.

#!In this paper we introduce a relighting algorithm for diffuse outdoor scenes that enables us to create geometrically correct and illumination consistent models from a series of range scans and a set of overlapping photographs that have been taken under different illumination conditions. To perform the relighting we compute a set of mappings from the overlap region of two images. We call these mappings Irradiance Ratio Maps (IRMs). Our algorithm handles cast shadows, being able to relight shadowed regions into non-shadowed regions and vice-versa. We solve these cases by computing four different IRMs, to handle all four combinations of shadowed vs. non-shadowed surfaces. To relight the non-overlapping region of an image, we look into the appropriate IRM which we index on surface normal, and apply its value to the corresponding pixels. The result is an illumination consistent set of images.

#!In this paper we present a method for automatically constructing a CAD model of an unknown object from range images. The method is an incremental one that interleaves a sensing operation that acquires and merges information into the model with a planning phase to determine the next sensor position or "view". This is accomplished by integrating a system for 3-D model acquisition with a sensor planner. The model acquisition system provides facilities for range image acquisition, solid model construction and model merging: both mesh surface and solid representations are used to build a model of the range data from each view, which is then merged with the model built from previous sensing operations. The planning system utilizes the resulting incomplete model to plan the next sensing operation by finding a sensor viewpoint that will improve the fidelity of the model. Experimental results are presented for a complex part that includes polygonal faces, curved surfaces, and large self-occlusions.

Using these estimated hand positions, virtual clay is shaped based on a direct free-form deformation technique. To improve processing speed, we implemented the proposed system on a PC cluster. This system proves the feasibility of an intuitive virtual clay modeling system.

#!In this paper; we present an approach that is able to reconstruct 3D models from extended video sequences captured with an uncalibrated hand-held camera. We focus on two specific issues: (1) key-frame selection, and ( 2 ) projective drift. Given a long video sequence it is often not practical to work with all videoframes. In addition, to allow for effective outlier rejection and motion estimation it is necessary to have a sufficient baseline between frames. For this purpose, we propose a key-frame selection procedure based on a robust model selection criterion. Our approach guarantees that the camera motion can be estimated reliably by analyzing the feature correspondences between three consecutive views. Another problem for long uncalibrated video sequences is projective drift. Error accumulation leads to a non-projective distortion of the model. This causes the projective basis at the beginning and the end of the sequence to become inconsistent and leads to the failure of self-calibration. We propose a self-calibration approach that is insensitive to this global projective drift. Afterself-calibration triplets of key-frames are aligned using absolute orientation and hierarchically merged into a complete metric reconstruction. Next, we compute a detailed 3D surface model using stereo matching. The 3D model is textured using some of the frames.

#!A range intensity image, which is also called a reflectance image, refers to the intensity image that is acquired simultaneously with the range image captured using an active range sensor. This paper proposes a method that uses this image to correct the color information of a textured 3D model. The color information is usually obtained by texture mapping of color images acquired by a digital camera. The lighting condition for the color images are usually not controlled, thus the color information is not precise. On the other hand, the lighting condition for the range intensity image is controlled since it is obtained from a controlled and known lighting as required for the purpose of range measurement. The paper describes the method for combining the two sources of information; experiments show the effectiveness of the correction method.

#!Recently, researches and developments for measuring and modeling of human body are taking much attention. Our aim is to capture accurate shape of human foot, using 2D images acquired by multiple cameras, which can capture dynamic behavior of the object. In this paper, 3D active shape models is used for accurate reconstruction of surface shape of human foot. We apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of human shape database, so that we can represent humanýs foot shape by approximately 12 principal component shapes. Because of the reduction of dimensions for representing the object shape, we can efficiently recover the object shape from multi-camera images, even though the object shape is partially occluded in some of input views. To demonstrate the proposed method, two kinds of experiments are presented: high accuracy reconstruction of human foot in a virtual reality environment with CG multi-camera images and in real world with eight CCD cameras. In those experiments, the recovered shape error with our method is around 2mm, while the error is around 4mm with volume intersection method.

#!Textured surface models of three-dimensional objects are gaining importance in computer graphics applications. These models often have to be merged from several overlapping partial models which have to be registered (i.e. the relative transformation between the partial models has to be determined) prior to the merging process. In this paper a method is presented that makes use of both camera-based depth information (e.g. from stereo) and the luminance image. The luminance information is exploited to determine corresponding point sets on the partial surfaces using an optical flow approach. Quaternions are then employed to determine the transformation between the partial models which minimizes the sum of the 3-D Euclidian distances between the corresponding point sets. In order to find corresponding points on the partial surfaces luminance information is linearized. The procedure is iterated until convergence is reached. In contrast to only using depth information, employing luminance speeds up convergence and reduces remaining degrees of freedom (e.g. when registering sphere-like shapes).

#!We present a novel real-time image-based rendering system for generating realistic novel views of complex scenes from a set of uncalibrated images. A combination ofstructure-and-motion and stereo techniques is used to obtain calibrated cameras and dense depth maps for all recorded images. These depth maps are converted into restrictive quadtrees, which allow for adaptive, view-dependent tessellations while storing per-vertex quality. When rendering a novel view, a subset of suitable cameras is selected based upon a ranking criterion. In the spirit of the unstructured lumigraph rendering approach a blending field is evaluated, although the implementation is adapted on several points. We alleviate the need for the creation of a geometric proxy for each novel view while the camera blending field is sampled in a more optimal, non-uniform way and combined with the per-vertex quality to reduce texture artifacts. In order to make real-time visualization possible, all critical steps of the visualization pipeline are programmed in a highly optimized way on commodity graphics hardware using the OpenGL Shading Language. The proposed system can handle complex scenes such as large outdoor scenes as well as small objects with a large number of acquired images.

#!We present a novel approach on digitizing large scale unstructured environments like archaeological excavations using off-the-shelf digital still cameras. The cameras are calibrated with respect to few markers captured by a theodolite system. Having all cameras registered in the same coordinate system enables a volumetric approach. Our new algorithm has as input multiple calibrated images and outputs an occupancy voxel space where occupied pixels have a local orientation and a confidence value. Both, orientation and confidence facilitate an efficient rendering and texture mapping of the resulting point cloud. Our algorithm combines the following new features: Images are back-projected to hypothesized local patches in the world and correlated on these patches yielding the best orientation. Adjacent cameras build tuples which yield a product of pairwise correlations, called strength. Multiple camera tuples compete each other for the best strength for each voxel. A voxel is regarded as occupied if strength is maximum along the normal. Unlike other multi-camera algorithms using silhouettes, photoconsistency, or global correspondence, our algorithm makes no assumption on camera locations being outside the convex hull of the scene. We present compelling results of outdoors excavation areas.

The mechanism is based on a reference double-frame that acts as the coordinate system of the scene. A single-view range image of a scene is obtained by sweeping a laser line over the scene by hand and analyzing the acquired light stripes. Range images captured from different views of the scene will be in the coordinate system of the double-frame, and thus, will automatically integrate without further processing.

A rating function for the planning is defined to take into consideration the factors such as possibility of merging new data, registration accuracy and control point selection.

We propose a method for improving the signal-to-noise ratio of the total phase change by incorporating data from the intermediate phase values. The performance of the method is compared theoretical and experimentally, using data from a fringe projector based on a spatial tight modulator. The best way to use the method is with /spl Phi/ decreasing exponentially with time from its maximum value to zero; this provides significant improvements in reliability, accuracy and computation time compared with the original temporal unwrapping algorithm.

#!Estimating the motion of a moving camera in an unknown environment is essential for a number of applications ranging from as-built reconstruction to augmented reality. It is a challenging problem especially when real-time performance is required. Our approach is to estimate the camera motion while reconstructing the shape and appearance of the most salient visual features in the scene. In our 3D reconstruction process, correspondences are obtained by tracking the visual features from frame to frame with optical flow tracking. Optical-flow-based tracking methods have limitations in tracking the salient features. Often larger translational motions and even moderate rotational motions can result in drifts. We propose to augment flow-based tracking by building a landmark representation around reliably reconstructed features. A planar patch around the reconstructed feature point provides matching information that prevents drifts in flow-based feature tracking and allows establishment of correspondences across the frames with large baselines. Selective and periodic such correspondence mappings drastically improve scene and motion reconstruction while adhering to the real-time requirements. The method is experimentally tested to be both accurate and computational efficient.

#!Automatic range image registration without any knowledge of the viewpoint requires identification of common regions across different range images and then establishing point correspondences in these regions. We formulate this as a graph-based optimization problem. More specifically, we define a graph in which each vertex represents a putative match of two points, each edge represents binary consistency decision between two matches, and each edge orientation represents match quality from worse to better putative match. Then strict sub-kernel defined in the graph is maximized. The maximum strict sub-kernel algorithm enables us to uniquely determine the largest consistent matching of points. To evaluate the quality of a single match, we employ the histogram of triple products that are generated by all surface normals in a point neighborhood. Our experimental results show the effectiveness of our method for rough range image registration.

The movable screen, with 6 degrees of freedom, can act like a window into 3D virtual environments and allows for efficient 2D and 3D interaction at the same time. We report on the pose estimation system of the Planar's display where we focus on two enhanced optical mice combined to track horizontal 2D position/orientation. Results of this pragmatic approach are presented and discussed. In order to demonstrate the potential of the Planar we show a small review/sketching/annotation application. The overall goal of this work is to contribute to the development of real VR applications.

#!This paper presents a new method for reconstructing animated, anatomy-based facial models of individuals from range data with minimal manual intervention. A prototype model with a multi-layer skin-muscle-skull structure serves as the starting point for our method. After the global adaptation, the skin mesh of the prototype model is represented as a dynamic deformable model which is deformed to fit scanned data according to internal force stemming from the elastic properties of the surface and external forces produced from the scanned data points and features. The underlying muscle layer that consists of three types of facial muscles is automatically adapted. According to the adapted skin and muscle structures, a set of automatically generated skull feature points is transformed to drive a volume morphing of the template skull model for skull fitting. The reconstructed model realistically reproduces the shape and features of a specific person and can be animated instantly.

#!Iterative Closest Point (ICP) -based tracking works well when the interframe motion is within the ICP minimum well space. For large interframe motions resulting from a limited sensor acquisition rate relative to the speed of the object motion, it suffers from slow convergence and a tendency to be stalled by local minima. A novel method is proposed to improve the performance of ICP-based tracking. The method is based upon the Bounded Hough Transform (BHT) which estimates the object pose in a coarse discrete pose space. Given an initial pose estimate, and assuming that the interframe motion is bounded in all 6 pose dimensions, the BHT estimates the current frameýs pose. On its own, the BHT is able to track an objectýs pose in sparse range data both efficiently and reliably, albeit with a limited precision. Experiments on both simulated and real data show the BHT to be more efficient than a number of variants of the ICP for a similar degree of reliability. A hybrid method has also been implemented wherein at each frame the BHT is followed by a few ICP iterations. This hybrid method is more efficient than the ICP, and is more reliable than either the BHT or ICP separately.

#!The present paper focuses on efficient inverse rendering using a Photometric Stereo technique for realistic surfaces. The technique primarily assumes the Lambertian reflection model only. For non-Lambertian surfaces, application of the technique to real surfaces in order to estimate 3-D shape and spatially varying reflectance from sparse images remains difficult. In the present paper, we propose a new Photometric Stereo technique by which to efficiently recover a full surface model, starting from a small set of photographs. The proposed technique allows diffuse albedo to vary arbitrarily over surfaces while non-diffuse characteristics remain constant for a material. Specifically, the basic approach is to first recover the specular reflectance parameters of the surfaces by a novel optimization procedure. These parameters are then used to estimate the diffuse reflectance and surface normal for each point. As a result, a lighting-independent model of the geometry and reflectance properties of the surface is established using the proposed method, which can be used to re-render the images under novel lighting via traditional rendering methods.

#!Recent acquisition systems, such as the one developed at the University of California at Berkeley, are capable of collecting large, detailed, highly textured models that standard levels of detail (LOD) rendering techniques [Adaptive display algorithm for interactive frame rates during visualization of complex virtual environments] cannot handle efficiently. We propose an out-of-core rendering engine which applies the cost and benefit approach of the Adaptive Display algorithm by Funkhouser and Séquin [Adaptive display algorithm for interactive frame rates during visualization of complex virtual environments] to Hierarchical Levels of Detail (HLODs) [HLODs for faster display of large static and dynamic environments]. Unlike the Adaptive Display algorithm, we do not skip objects to maintain interactivity when many objects are visible. Funkhouser and Séquin apply hysteresis by adding a penalty in the benefit heuristics to discourage disturbing visual effects due to fast switching of detail in the model. However, this penalty may not be sufficient if the user is moving around rapidly in the scene. Instead, we have developed a more robust temporal hysteresis by retaining how much detail is rendered over a time period. We have implemented our rendering engine to run on a common personal computer with a standard graphics card. The engine is capable of visualizing, in both walk-through and fly-through mode, a detailed model of 25 city blocks comprised of 7 million triangles and 720 million color pixels. Our engine maintains a constant frame rate and limits excessive flickering simultaneously.

The aim of this method is to recover 3D information in moving scenes in such a way that the correspondence problem is easily and robustly solved. With this goal in mind a six-connectivity topology has been introduced in our pattern and color features have been inserted on it. Repetition and disorder are allowed in the codeword which implies that the Hamming distance between contiguous codewords increases. As a consequence of that, code loss circumstances can be efficiently handled. Additionally, computational cost in the code recovering phase is highly reduced since codewords are defined as sets. A structured light projection system has been built in our lab and a wide test under real moving conditions has been carried out. This experimentation has been performed on medium resolution and for slow movements specifications giving promising results.

First, the images are automatically registered by matching 2D image lines with projections of 3D lines from the city model. Then, for each triangle in the model, the optimal image is selected by taking into account occlusion, image resolution, surface normal orientation, and coherence with neighboring triangles. Finally, the utilized texture patches from all images are combined into one texture atlas for compact representation and efficient rendering. We evaluate our approach on a data set of downtown Berkeley.

#!Processing of image sequences has progressed from simple structure from motion paradigm to the recognition of actions / interactions as events. Understanding human activities in video has many potential applications including automated surveillance, video archival/retrieval, medical diagnosis, sports analysis, and human-computer interaction. Understanding human activities involves various steps of low-level vision processing such as segmentation, tracking, pose recovery, and trajectory estimation as well as high-level processing tasks such as body modeling and representation of action. While low-level processing has been actively studied, high-level processing is just beginning to receive attention. This is partly because high-level processing depends on the results of low-level processing. However, high-level processing also requires some independent and additional approaches and methodologies. In this paper, we focus on the following aspects of high-level processing: (1) human body modeling, (2) level of detail needed to understand human actions, (3) approaches to human action recognition, and (4) high-level recognition schemes with domain knowledge. The review is illustrated by examples of each of the areas discussed, including recent developments in our work on understanding human activities.

The topological Laplacian operator turns out to be the LSI operator of the topological realization of the mesh. More generally, assuming different geometric realizations or metrics allows interpreting various mesh processing techniques as LSI operators.

As a site is exposed, documentation is required in order to recreate and understand the site in context. We have developed a 3D modeling pipeline that can assist archaeologists in the documentation effort by building rich, geometrically and photometrically accurate 3D models of the site. The modeling effort begins with data acquisition (images, range scans, GIS data, and video) and ends with the use of a sophisticated visualization tool that can be used by researchers to explore and understand the site. The pipeline includes new methods for shadow-based registration of 2D images and temporal change detection. Our multimodal augmented reality system allows users wearing head-tracked, see-through, head-worn displays to visualize the site model and associated archaeological artifacts, and to interact with them using speech and gesture.

Application of this technology to record 3D data has increased significantly the accuracy of reconstructed shape and simplified data manipulation process. In the paper the general concept of virtual reality system supported by data gathered by means of structure light projection is presented. The methodology of conversion of cloud of measurement points (x,y,z,R,G,B) into virtual reality environment is described. It is supported by implementation of a virtual camera concept, as the mean for interactive object visualization. The methodology of real time 3D object visualization based on its coding by means of specially formed contours and their B-spline approximation is presented. The applicability of the methodology has been shown on numerically generated data which simulate performance of the measurement system. The total processing path was successfully tested.

The method works with rigid data having arbitrary relative position and orientation and proves to be robust with respect to CT acquisition noise and with respect to the segmentation technique adopted to select the region of interest for registration. The method is capable of registering correctly data sets taken from the same articulation and whose components have undergone small relative displacements. The method is also amenable to registration of heteregeneous kinds of volumetric data, e.g., CT scans and Magnetic Resonance Imagery (MRI) scans, which show different characteristics in correspondence to the same organic structure.

#!In this paper, we present an algorithm to combine edge information from stereo-derived depth maps with edges from the original intensity/color image to improve the contour detection in images of natural scenes. After computing the disparity map, we generate a so-called "edge combination image", which relies on those edges of the original image that are also present in the stereo map. We describe an algorithm to identify corresponding intensity and depth edges, which are usually slightly displaced due to non-perfect stereo reconstruction. Our experiments demonstrate how the proposed edge combination approach can be used in conjunction with an active contours algorithm to achieve better segmentation results.

#!In recent years, there have been significant strides in increasing quality of range from stereo using global techniques such as energy minimization. These methods cannot yet achieve real-time performance. However, the need to improve range quality for real-time applications persists. All real-time stereo implementations rely on a simple correlation step which employs some local similarity metric between the left and right image. Typically, the correlation takes place on an image pair modified in some way to compensate for photometric variations between the left and right cameras. Improvements and modifications to such algorithms tend to fall into one of two broad categories: those which address the correlation step itself (e.g., shiftable windows, adaptive windows) and those which address the pre-processing of input imagery (e.g. band-pass filtering, Rank, Census). Our efforts lie in the latter area. We present in this paper a modification of the standard band-pass filtering technique used by many SSD- and SAD-based correlation algorithms. By using the bilateral filter of Tomasi and Manduchi [Bilateral filtering for gray and color images], we minimize blurring at the filtering stage. We show that in conjunction with SAD correlation, our new method improves stereo quality at range discontinuities while maintaining real-time performance.

#!The paper presents a method for the high speed calculation of crude depth maps. Performance and applicability are illustrated for view interpolation based on two input video streams, but the algorithm is perfectly amenable to multi-camera environments. First a fast plane sweep algorithm generates the crude depth map. Speed results from hardware accelerated transformations and parallel processing available on the GPU. All computations on the graphical board are performed pixel-wise and a single pass of the sweep only processes one input resolution. A second step uses a min-cut/max-flow algorithm to ameliorate the previous result. The depth map, a noisy interpolated image and correlation measures are available on the GPU. They are reused and combined with spatial connectivity information and temporal continuity considerations in a graph formulation. Position dependent sampling densities allow the system to use multiple image resolutions. The min-cut separation of this graph yields the global minimum of the associated energy function. Limiting the search range according to the initialisation provided by the plane sweep further speeds up the process. The required hardware are only two cameras and a regular PC.

#!The management of big databases of three-dimensional models (used in CAD applications, visualization, games, etc.) is a very important domain. The ability to characterize and easily retrieve models is a key issue for the designers and the final users. In this frame, two main approaches exist: search by example of a three-dimensional model, and search by a 2D view. In this paper, we present a novel framework for the characterization of a 3D model by a set of views (called characteristic views), and an indexing process of these models with a Bayesian probabilistic approach using the characteristic views. The framework is independent from the descriptor used for the indexing. We illustrate our results using different descriptors on a collection of threedimensional models supplied by Renault Group.

#!The present paper proposes a novel method for 3D-model watermarking for indexing. The proposed approach is based on the use of a Generalized Radon Transformation. More specifically, the Cylindrical Integration Transform (CIT) is initially applied to the 3D models in order to produce descriptor vectors. At the same time a watermarking technique, based on CIT is used in order to embed a specific model identifier in the nodes of the 3D model. This identifier links the model to its descriptor vector, which is extracted only once and stored in a database. Every time this model is employed as a query model, watermark detection is used so as to retrieve the corresponding identifier and further the descriptor vector, which can be further used in a matching algorithm. The proposed techniques are evaluated experimentally in terms of both watermarking efficiency and content-based retrieval performance.

#!Solving the correspondence problem is the most essential task for multiview reconstruction techniques, yet finding unique correspondences between multiple views is impossible at some points, due to such problems as occlusions and ambiguities. We have developed a closed-form solution through constructive geometry for a special case of the structure-from-motion (SfM) problem with four rigidly moving points. This solution allows the 3-D position of a point on a moving object to be computed without having to find the correspondence between its projections on the image planes of multiple views, given its projected 2-D motion vector on an image plane and 3-D information of three other points. With this method we do not have to depend entirely on stereo/multiview feature correspondences in reconstructing 3-D objects, hence easing those problems caused by occlusions and ambiguities.

#!This paper addresses the problem of rigid motion estimation and 3D reconstruction in vision systems where it is possible to recover the incident light ray direction from the image points. Such systems include pinhole cameras and catadioptric cameras. Given two images of the same scene acquired from two different positions, the transformation is estimated by means of an iterative process. The estimation process aims at having corresponding incident rays intersecting at the same 3D point. Geometrical relationships are derived to support the estimation method. Furthermore, this paper also addresses the problem of the mapping from 3D points to image points, for non-central catadioptric cameras with mirror surfaces given by quadrics. The projection model presented can be expressed in a non-linear equation of only one variable, being more stable and easier to solve than the classical Snell's law. Experiments with real images are presented, by using simulated annealing as estimation method.

#!This paper presents an efficient and scalable coding scheme for transmitting a stream of 3D models extracted from a video.As in classical model-based video coding, the geometry, connectivity, and texture of the 3D models have to be transmitted, as well as the camera position for each frame in the original video. The proposed method is based on exploiting the interrelations existing between each type of information, instead of coding them independently, allowing a better prediction of the next 3D model in the stream. Scalability is achieved through the use of wavelet-based representations for both texture and geometry of the models. A consistent connectivity is built for all 3D models extracted from the video sequence, which allows a more compact representation and straightforward geometric morphing between successive models. Furthermore this leads to a consistent wavelet decomposition for 3D models in the stream. Quantitative and qualitative results for the proposed scheme are compared with the state of the art video coder H264, 3D model-based Galpin coder and independent MPEG4-based coding of the information. Targeted applications include distant visualization of the original video at very low bitrate and interactive navigation in the extracted 3D scene on heterogeneous terminals.

#!A commonly encountered problem when creating 3D models of large real scenes is unnatural color texture fusion. Due to variations in lighting and camera settings (both manual and automatic), captured color texture maps of the same structure can have very different colors. When fusing multiple views to create larger models, this color variation leads to a poor appearance with odd color tilings on homogeneous surfaces. This paper extends previous research on pairwise global color correction to multiple overlapping images. The central idea is to estimate a set of blending transformations that minimize the overall color discrepancy in the overlapping regions, thus spreading residual color errors, rather than letting them accumulate.

#!This paper presents a stereoscopic image coder based on the MRF model and MAP estimation of the disparity field. The MRF model minimizes the noise of the disparity compensation because it takes into account the residual energy, smoothness constraints and the occlusion field. The disparity compensation is formulated as a MAP-MRF problem in the spatial domain and the MRF field consists of the disparity vector and occlusion field, which is partitioned into three regions by an initial double-threshold setting. The MAP search is conducted in a block-based sense on one or two of the three regions, providing faster execution. The reference and the residual images are decomposed by a discrete wavelet transform and the transform coefficients are encoded by employing the morphological representation of wavelet coefficients algorithm. As a result of the morphological encoding, the reference and residual images together with the disparity vector field are transmitted in partitions lowering the total entropy. The experimental evaluation on synthetic and real images shows beneficial performance of the proposed algorithm.

#!Computer graphics cameras lack the finite Depth of Field (DOF) present in real world ones. This results in all objects being rendered sharp regardless of their depth, reducing the realism of the scene. On top of that, real-world DOF provides a depth cue, that helps the human visual system decode the elements of a scene. Several methods have been proposed to render images with finite DOF, but these have always implied an important trade-off between speed and accuracy. In this paper, we introduce a novel anisotropic diffusion Partial Differential Equation (PDE) that is applied to the 2D image of the scene rendered with a pin-hole camera. In this PDE, the amount of blurring on the 2D image depends on the depth information of the 3D scene, present in the Z-buffer. This equation is well posed, has existence and uniqueness results, and it is a good approximation of the optical phenomenon, without the visual artifacts and depth inconsistencies present in other approaches. Because both inputs to our algorithm are present at the graphics card at every moment, we can run the processing entirely in the GPU. This fact, coupled with the particular numerical scheme chosen for our PDE, allows for real-time rendering using a programmable graphics card.

#!In this paper we present a method for estimation of 3D motion of a rigid object from a video sequence, while simultaneously learning the parameters of an illumination model that describe the lighting conditions under which the video was captured. This is achieved by alternately estimating motion and illumination parameters in a recently proposed mathematical framework for integrating the effects of motion, illumination and structure. The motion is represented in terms of translation and rotation of the object centroid, and the illumination is represented using a spherical harmonics linear basis. The method does not assume any model for the variation of the illumination conditions-lighting can change slowly or drastically, locally or globally. Also, it can be composed of combinations of point and extended sources. For multiple cameras viewing an object, we derive a new photometric constraint that relates the illumination parameters in two or more independent video sequences. This constraint allows verification of the illumination parameters obtained from multiple views and synthesis of new views under the same lighting conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in tracking under severe changes of lighting conditions.

Reflectivity variations recorded at the surface by Magellan are likely to extend into subsurface, providing dielectric contrast at interfaces.

#!This paper presents a fast and robust method to precisely segment and locate bore holes of 4 to 50mm diameter. The task is solved by a robot moving a compact triangulation scanning sensor to all sides of the object and scanning the bore holes. Exploiting the knowledge about the expected bore diameter and bore pose makes it possible to develop highly robust algorithms for an industrial application. Sparse data of the bore hole is sufficient to segment the bore independent of bore hole chamfer type using a robust normal vector fit and a classification based on the Gaussian image. A sequential algorithm to fit the bore cylinder makes it possible to calculate the bore pose in less than 1 second. Experiments demonstrate that 120 degrees of the bore hole surface are sufficient for robust localization within 0.3mm and 0.5 degrees even in the presence of ghost points and notches in the bore holes.

#!Helmholtz Stereopsis (HS) has recently been explored as a promising technique for capturing shape of objects with unknown reflectance. So far, it has been widely applied to objects of smooth geometry and piecewise uniform Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF). Moreover, for non-convex surfaces the inter-reflection effects have been completely neglected. We extend the method to surfaces which exhibit strong texture, nontrivial geometry and are possibly non-convex. The problem associated with these surface features is that Helmholtz reciprocity is apparently violated when point-based measurements are used independently to establish the matching constraint as in the standard HS implementation. We argue that the problem is avoided by computing radiance measurements on image regions corresponding exactly to projections of the same surface point neighbourhood with appropriate scale. The experimental results demonstrate the success of the novel method proposed on real objects.

#!This paper presents a new acquisition method for 3D laser scanners that combines imaging, fast geometrical object tracking, and automatic pose estimation to register range profiles of freely moving objects. The method was developed to solve the constraint of rigidity between free-moving objects and a 3D scanner while preserving the accuracy of the range measurements. Rigidity constraint imposes that a 3D scanner or any external positioning devices must be perfectly stable relative to the object during scanning. This is often impossible for moving structures such as when using scaffolding, industrial conveyers, or robotic arms. The method starts by creating a rough, partial, and distorted estimate of the model of the object from an initial subset of sparse range data. Then, it recursively improves and refines the model by adding new range information. In parallel, real-time tracking of the object is performed to center the scan on the object. A high-resolution and accurate 3D model of a free-floating object, and real-time tracking of its position is obtained.

#!General information about a class of objects, such as human faces or teeth, can help to solve the otherwise ill-posed problem of reconstructing a complete surface from sparse 3D feature points or 2D projections of points. We present a technique that uses a vector space representation of shape (3D Morphable Model) to infer missing vertex coordinates. Regularization derived from a statistical approach makes the system stable and robust with respect to noise by computing the optimal tradeoff between fitting quality and plausibility. We present a direct, non-iterative algorithm to calculate this optimum efficiently, and a method for simultaneously compensating unknown rigid transformations. The system is applied and evaluated in two different fields: (1) reconstruction of 3D faces at unknown orientations from 2D feature points at interactive rates, and (2) restoration of missing surface regions of teeth for CAD-CAM production of dental inlays and other medical applications.

#!Modern automatic digitizers can sample huge amounts of 3D data points on the object surface in a short time. Point based graphics is becoming a popular framework to reduce the cardinality of these data sets and to filter measurement noise, without having to store in memory and process mesh connectivity. Main contribution of this paper is the introduction of soft clustering techniques in the field of point clouds processing. In this approach data points are not assigned to a single cluster, but they contribute in the determination of the position of several cluster centres. As a result a better representation of the data is achieved. In Soft clustering techniques, a data set is represented with a reduced number of points called Reference Vectors (RV), which minimize an adequate error measure. As the position of the RVs is determined by "learning", which can be viewed as an iterative optimization procedure, they are inherently slow. We show here how partitioning the data domain into disjointed regions called hyperboxes (HB), the computation can be localized and the computational time reduced to linear in the number of data points (O(N)), saving more than 75% on real applications with respect to classical soft-VQ solutions, making therefore VQ suitable to the task. The procedure is suitable for a parallel HW implementation, which would lead to a complexity sub-linear in N. An automatic procedure for setting the voxel side and the other parameters can be derived from the data-set analysis. Results obtained in the reconstruction of faces of both humans and puppets as well as on models from clouds of points made available on the WEB are reported and discussed in comparison with other available methods.

#!2D or 3D shapes are the most important visual information that we use to recognize an object. We propose a unified framework "ShapeLab" to search similar 2D or 3D shapes from an existing database. Users can search 3D shapes with a 2D input, and vice versa. ShapeLab is composed of four key components: (1) pose determination for 3D models; (2) 2D orthogonal view generation based on multiple levels of detail; (3) similarity measurement between 2D shapes; and (4) freehand sketch-based user interface. Key algorithms supporting the above components are briefly described. Experiments show ShapeLab can provide a better performance such as high accuracy, flexibility and scalability compared to the available methods.

#!Hand-guided scanners allow for digitization by manually sweeping a laser beam over an object's surface. The result highly depends on the way the user handles the system and his ability to keep track of the parts of the surface that are already scanned. Processing and visualization during data acquisition are helpful in this context. In this paper, we propose an online surface reconstruction algorithm for the visualization of the DLR scanner system data. The algorithm successively generates a triangle mesh by incrementally inserting 3D points. Point neighborhoods are used to limit the point density, to estimate the surface normal at the inserted point, and to locally re-triangulate the mesh. A dynamic data structure for fast neighborhood search without restrictions to the amount of vertices or the object size and with low complexity is introduced. Finally, results with the hand-guided scanner system are presented.

#!It is widely known that, for the affine camera model, both shape and motion data can be factorized directly from the measurement matrix constructed from 2D image points coordinates. However, classical algorithms for Structure from Motion (SfM) are not robust: measurement outliers, that is, incorrectly detected or matched feature points can destroy the result. A few methods to robustify SfM have already been proposed. Different outlier detection schemes have been used. We examine an efficient algorithm by Trajkovic et al. [Robust recursive structure and motion recovery under affine projection] who use affine camera model and the Least Median of Squares (LMedS) method to separate inliers from outliers. LMedS is only applicable when the ratio of inliers exceeds 50%. We show that the Least Trimmed Squares (LTS) method is more efficient in robust SfM than LMedS. In particular, we demonstrate that LTS can handle inlier ratios below 50%. We also show that using the real (Euclidean) motion data results in a more precise SfM algorithm that using the affine camera model. Based on these observations, we propose a novel robust SfM algorithm and discuss its advantages and limits. The proposed method and the Trajkovicprocedure are quantitatively compared on synthetic data in different simulated situations. The methods are also tested on synthesized and real video sequences.

#!Height fields and depth maps which we collectively refer to as z-fields, usually carry a lot of redundant information and are often used in real-time applications. This is the reason why efficient methods for their simplification are necessary. On the other hand, the computation power and programmability of commodity graphics hardware has significantly grown. We present an adaptation of an existing real-time z-field simplification method for execution in graphics hardware. The main parts of the algorithm are implemented as fragment programs which run on the GPU. The resulting polygonal models are identical to the ones obtained by the original method. The main benefit is that the computation load is imposed on the GPU, freeing-up the CPU for other tasks. Additionally, the new method exhibits a performance improvement when compared to a pure CPU implementation.

#!This paper presents a unified framework for model-based and model-free reconstruction of people from multiple camera views in a studio environment. Shape and appearance of the reconstructed model are optimised simultaneously based on multiple view silhouette, stereo and feature correspondence. A priori knowledge of surface structure is introduced as regularisation constraints. Model-based reconstruction assumes a known generic humanoid model a priori, which is fitted to the multi-view observations to produce a structured representation for animation. Model-free reconstruction makes no priori assumptions on scene geometry allowing the reconstruction of complex dynamic scenes. Results are presented for reconstruction of sequences of people from multiple views. The model-based approach produces a consistent structured representation, which is robust in the presence of visual ambiguities. This overcomes limitations of existing visual-hull and stereo techniques. Model-free reconstruction allows high-quality novel view-synthesis with accurate reproduction of the detailed dynamics for hair and loose clothing. Multiple view optimisation achieves a visual quality comparable to the captured video without visual artefacts due to misalignment of images.

#!This paper develops a digital watermarking methodology for 3-D graphical objects defined by polygonal meshes. In watermarking or fingerprinting the aim is to embed a code in a given media without producing identifiable changes to it. One should be able to retrieve the embedded information even after the shape had suffered various modifications. Two blind watermarking techniques applying perturbations onto the local geometry for selected vertices are described in this paper. The proposed methods produce localized changes of vertex locations that do not alter the mesh topology. A study of the effects caused by vertex location modification is provided for a general class of surfaces. The robustness of the proposed algorithms is tested at noise perturbation and object cropping.

The data acquisition system is capable of acquire 3D data from urban areas with centimetre resolution including automatic capturing of colour. The system includes a management and interactive rendering software which is designed to cope with the huge quantities of data generated by the acquisition system. It uses out-of-core pre-processing to transform data into octrees. Real-time interactive rendering is achieved by using novel techniques such as front-to-back octree traversal, occlusion query and speculative pre-fetching. The paper presents the results of the described techniques applied to large public areas including the City Centre of Verona, Italy.

#!Polygonal Models are ubiquitous in Computer Graphics but their real time manipulation and rendering especially in interactive application environments have become a threat because of their huge sizes and complexity. A whole family of automatic algorithms emerged during the last decade to help out this problem, but they reduce the complexity of the models uniformly without caring about semantic importance of localized parts of a mesh. Only a few algorithms deal with adaptive simplification of polygonal models. We propose a new model for user-driven simplification exploiting the simplification hierarchy and hypertriangulation model [A resolution modeling system] that lends a user the most of the functionalities of existing adaptive simplification algorithms in one place and is quite simple to implement. The proposed new underlying data structures are compact and support real time navigation across continuous LODs of a model; any desirable LOD can be extracted efficiently and can further be fine-tuned. The proposed model for adaptive simplification supports two key operations for selective refinement and selective simplification; their effect has been shown on various polygonal models. Comparison with related work shows that the proposed model provides combined environment at reduced overhead of memory space usage and faster running times.

#!We present a non-rigid alignment algorithm for aligning high-resolution range data in the presence of low-frequency deformations, such as those caused by scanner calibration error. Traditional iterative closest points (ICP) algorithms, which rely on rigid-body alignment, fail in these cases because the error appears as a non-rigid warp in the data. Our algorithm combines the robustness and efficiency of ICP with the expressiveness of thin-plate splines to align high-resolution scanned data accurately, such as scans from the Digital Michelangelo Project [The Digital Michelangelo Project: 3-D scanning of large statues]. This application is distinguished from previous uses of the thin-plate spline by the fact that the resolution and size of warping are several orders of magnitude smaller than the extent of the mesh, thus requiring especially precise feature correspondence.

#!As well known, in the reconstruction of the 3D models through optical systems, the errors are due to the single-view acquisition error and to the 3D modeling procedure. The latter can be ascribed to the various phases of the 3D modeling pipeline: pairwise registration, global registration, surface integration. This work examines the acquisition error as well as the errors due to an automatic procedure recently proposed for the 3D modeling of dental plaster casts. This contribution derives a simple error propagation model, rather useful for practical simulation purposes. From a general viewpoint, this contribution proposes a useful simulation of error propagation in 3D modeling, it shows the quality of an automatic 3D modeling procedure recently proposed and it shows the accuracy of 3D modeling dental plaster casts by current commercial range cameras and the considered automatic method.

The approach is equivalent to Gaussian smoothing on the sphere and is computationally efficient since it does not require iterative smoothing. Furthermore, it does not suffer from the well-known shrinkage problem. Evolution of important shape features (parabolic curves) under diffusion is demonstrated. A nonlinear modification of the diffusion process is introduced in order to improve smoothing behavior of elongated and poorly centered objects.

The first one consists in segmenting the main tissues in these images (skin, fat, muscles, cortical and marrow bones, cerebrospinal fluid, grey and white matter, blood, etc).The segmentation is based on mathematical morphology methods which are well adapted to this aim and provide a robust and automatic method requiring minimum user intervention.Using simplified segmented images, the second step concerns the tetrahedral mesh generation.Our method uses almost regular meshes and topological tools to preserve the topological arrangement of the head tissues.A method to guarantee a good geometrical quality is also provided.

#!Experimental structure analysis of biological molecules (e.g, proteins) or macromolecular complexes (e.g, viruses) can be used to generate three-dimensional density maps of these entities. Such a density map can be viewed as a three-dimensional gray-scale image where space is subdivided in voxels of a given size. The focus of this paper is the analysis of virus density maps. The hull of a virus consists of many copies of one or several different proteins. An important tool for the study of viruses is cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), a technique with insufficient resolution to directly determine the arrangement of the proteins in the virus. We therefore created a tool that locates proteins in the three-dimensional density map of a virus. The goal is to fully determine the locations and orientations of the protein(s) in the virus given the virus' three-dimensional density map and a database of density maps of one or more protein candidates.

Defining the aspects that constitute the similarity among 3D objects, and designing algorithms that implement such similarity definitions is a difficult problem.

We present an extensive experimental evaluation of the retrieval effectiveness and efficiency of a large part of the current state-of-the-art feature-based methods for 3D similarity search, giving a contrasting assessment of the different approaches.

Ensemble is a very popular and powerful statistical technique based on the idea of averaging several outputs of a probabilistic algorithm. In the context of surface reconstruction, two main problems arise. The first is finding an efficient way to average meshes with different connectivity, and the second is tuning the parameters for surface reconstruction to maximize the performance of the ensemble. We solve the first problem by voxelizing all the meshes on the same regular grid and taking majority vote on each voxel. We tune the parameters experimentally, borrowing ideas from weak learning methods.

#!We describe an automatic system for fast unattended acquisition of accurate and complete 3D models, called RoboScan. The design goal is to reduce the three main bottlenecks in human-assisted 3D scanning: the selection of the range maps to be taken (view planning), the positioning of the scanner in the environment, and the range maps' alignment. The system is designed around a commercial laser-based 3D scanner moved by a robotic arm. The acquisition session is organised in two stages. First, an initial sampling of the surface is performed by the automatic selection of a set of views. Then, some added views are automatically selected, acquired and merged to the initial set in order to fill the surface regions left unsampled. Both the initial set of range maps and the subsequently added ones are post-processed automatically, by using the known scanner positions to initialise the alignment phase. Results of the assessment of the system on real acquisitions are presented and discussed.

#!We consider the following data fusion problem. A 3D object with textured Lambertian surface is measured and independently photographed. A triangulated model of the object and two uncalibrated images are obtained. The goal is to precisely register the images to the model. Solving this problem is necessary for building a geometrically accurate, photorealistic model from laser-scanned 3D data and high quality images. Recently, we have proposed a novel method that generalises the photo-consistency approach by Clarkson et al. [Using photo-consistency to register 2D optical images of the human face to a 3D surface model] to the case of uncalibrated cameras, when both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters are unknown. This gives a user the freedom of taking the pictures by a conventional digital camera, from arbitrary positions and with varying zoom. The method is based on manual pre-registration followed by a genetic optimisation algorithm. A brief description of the pilot version of the method [Precise registration of an uncalibrated image pair to a 3D surface model] has been given together with the results of a few initial tests. In this paper, we report on some new significant developments in this project. The critical issue of robustness against illumination changes is addressed and various colour representations and cost functions are tested and compared. Natural constraints are introduced and experimentally validated to simplify the camera model and accelerate the algorithm. Finally, we present synthetic and real data with ground truth, apply the improved method to the data and measure the quality of the results.

#!In this paper we explore how to improve the quality of the height map recovered from faces using shape-from-shading. One of the problems with reliable face surface reconstruction using shape-from-shading is that local errors in the needle map can cause implosion of facial features, and in particular the nose. To overcome this problem in this paper we develop a method for ensuring surface convexity. This is done by modifying the gradient orientations in accordance with critical points on the surface. We utilize a local shape indicator as a criteria to decide which surface normals are to be modified. Experiments show that altering the directions of a surface normal field of a face leads to a considerable improvement in its integrated height map.

When this folded picture is tilted back and forth horizontally the face undergoes striking changes in expression. This distortion reveals two insights concerning 3D representation in the human visual system and we have explored these with experiments on simple schematic faces and observations on distortions of laser range images of faces. The observations show first that when recovering depicted depth, pictorial cues are interpreted independently of binocular depth information and second, that the recovery of facial expression is based on a scaled prototypical face structure.

Most practical known methods are based on the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm, which requires an initial alignment close to the globally optimal solution to ensure convergence to a valid solution. Furthermore, it can also fail when there are points in one dataset with no corresponding matches in the other dataset. The proposed method automatically finds an initial alignment close to the global optimal by using the medial structure of the datasets. For this purpose, we first compute the medial scaffold of a 3D dataset: a 3D graph made of special shock curves linking special shock nodes. This medial scaffold is then regularized exploiting the known transitions of the 3D medial axis under deformation or perturbation of the input data. The resulting simplified medial scaffolds are then registered using a modified graduated assignment graph matching algorithm. The proposed method shows robustness to noise, shape deformations, and varying surface sampling densities.

#!A mesh conformation approach that makes use of deformable generic meshes has been applied to establishing correspondences between 3D shapes with missing data.Given a group of shapes with correspondences, we can build up a statistical shape model by applying principal component analysis (PCA). The conformation at first globally maps the generic mesh to the 3D shape based on manually located corresponding landmarks, and then locally deforms the generic mesh to clone the 3D shape.The local deformation is constrained by minimizing the energy of an elastic model.An algorithm was also embedded in the conformation process to fill missing surface data of the shapes.Using synthetic data, we demonstrate that the conformation preserves the configuration of the generic mesh and hence it helps to establish good correspondences for shape analysis.Case studies of the principal component analysis of shapes were presented to illustrate the successes and advantages of our approach.

#!In this paper we develop a computer vision-based system to transfer human motion from one subject to another. Our system uses a network of eight calibrated and synchronized cameras. We first build detailed kinematic models of the subjects based on our algorithms for extracting shape from silhouette across time [A 3D reconstruction algorithm combining shape-frame-shilhouette]. These models are then used to capture the motion (joint angles) of the subjects in new video sequences. Finally we describe an image-based rendering algorithm to render the captured motion applied to the articulated model of another person. Our rendering algorithm uses an ensemble of spatially and temporally distributed images to generate photo-realistic video of the transferred motion. We demonstrate the performance of the system by rendering throwing and kungfu motions on subjects who did not perform them.

#!We present a new method for defining neighborhoods, and assigning principal curvature frames, and mean and Gauss curvatures to the points of an unorganized oriented point-cloud. The neighborhoods are estimated by measuring implicitly the surface distance between points. The 3D shape recovery is based on conformal geometry, works directly on the cloud, does not rely on the generation of polygonal, or smooth models. Test results on publicly available synthetic data, as ground truth, demonstrate that the method compares favorably to the established approaches for quantitative 3D shape recovery. The proposed method is developed to serve applications involving point based rendering and reliable extraction of differential properties from noisy unorganized point-clouds.

#!A new approach to face verification from 3D data is presented. The method uses 3D registration techniques designed to work with resolution levels typical of the irregular point cloud representations provided by Structured Light scanning. Preprocessing using a-priori information of the human face and the Iterative Closest Point algorithm are employed to establish correspondence between test and target and to compensate for the non-rigid nature of the surfaces. Statistical modelling in the form of Gaussian Mixture Models is used to parameterise the distribution of errors in facial surfaces after registration and is employed to differentiate between intra- and extra-personal comparison of range images. An Equal Error Rate of 2.67% was achieved on the 30 subject manual subset of the the 3d_rma database.

#!In this paper, a real-time, handheld 3D model acquisition system consisting of a laser projector, a video camera and a turntable is described. The user projects a stripe of light at the 3D object by hand while rotating the object on a turntable. The projected light and LED markers attached to the laser projector and turntable are captured by the video camera. By estimating the 3D orientation of the laser projector and the turntable angle from the 2D locations of the markers, the 3D location of the surface lit by the laser can be calculated. In addition, post-processing algorithms for refining the estimated 3D data have been proposed. The algorithm not only improves the accuracy of the 3D measurement, but also achieves to decrease the number of LEDs for 3D data estimation; therefore, it significantly improves the userýs convenience in scanning the object. With this system, users can measure an entire 3D object in real-time.

#!A new approach to construction of robust features is proposed and applied to an instance of the correspondence problem. The main idea is to construct a synthetic image by a multiresolution sketch (MS) of an image and involve it into extraction of the invariants. The MS is constructed by processing the image with a scalable detector of the semi-local 1D-elements. Then, a synthetic image is constructed with all elements of the MS. Local maxima of the first and second derivatives of the synthetic image along discrete curves of the MS lead to some singular elements represented by the points of a 4D manifold. It turns out that a representative subset of the singular elements is stable. To prove that, the pair-wise correspondence between subsets of singular elements of two shots of a film was established experimentally by a consistency technique, which, unlike past approaches, does not involve epipolar constraints.

#!Volumetric methods based on implicit surfaces are commonly used in surface reconstruction from uniformly distributed sparse 3D data. The case of non-uniform distributed data has recently deserved more attention, because it occurs frequently in practice. This paper describes a volumetric approach to surface reconstruction from non-uniform data which is suitable for the reconstruction of surfaces from images, in particular from multiple views. Differently from volumetric methods which use both 3D surface points and surface normals, the approach does not use the surface normals because they are often unreliable when estimated from image data. The method is based on a hierarchical partitioning of the volume data set. The working volume is split and classified at different scales of spatial resolution into surface, internal and external voxels and this hierarchy is described by an octree structure in a multiscale framework. The octree structure is used to build a multiresolution description of the surface by means of compact support radial basis functions (RBF). A hierarchy of surface approximations at different levels of details is built by representing the voxels at the same octree level as RBF of similar spatial support. At each scale, information related to the reconstruction error drives the reconstruction process at the following finer scale. Preliminary results on synthetic data and future perspectives are presented.

Descriptors are extracted using the 3D Radon Transform and applying a set of functionals on the transform coefficients. Similarity measures are then created for the extracted descriptors and introduced into a 3D model-matching algorithm. This results to a very fast and accurate matching method. Experiments were performed using two different databases and comparing the proposed method with others. Experimental results show that the proposed method can be used for 3D model search and retrieval in a highly efficient manner.

#!With the increasing number of image communication applications especially in the low complexity domain, error concealment has become a very important field of research. Since many compression standards for images and videos are block-based a lot of methods were applied to conceal block losses in monocular images. The fast progress of capture, representation and display technologies for 3D image data advances the efforts on 3D concealment strategies. Because of their psycho-visual characteristics, stereoscopic images have to fulfill a very high quality demand. We propose an algorithm that makes use of the redundancies between two views of a stereo image pair. In many cases erroneous block bursts occur and can be highly disturbing, thus we will mainly concentrate on these errors. In addition, we focused on the quality assessment of several error concealment strategies. Beside the objective evaluation measures, we carried out a subjective quality test following the DSCQS methodology as proposed by MPEG. The results of this test demonstrate the efficiency of our approach.

#!Structured grids and some of their applications in natural sciences are discussed. The problem of their visualization and quantitative evaluation is considered and possible ways for itssolution sketched. Resampling a structured grid onto a regular one is such a possible solution offering the additional benefit of enabling quantitative evaluations, too. This resampling is achieved by a preliminary tetrahedronization of the structured grid(s)and a subsequent digitalization of the constituent tetrahedrons using an adaptation of the 3D-Bresenham algorithm. Advantages and disadvantages of this approach as compared to other possible schemes are discussed. An implementation based on our open source f3d-file format for storage and transmission of volumetric data is presented, and results from applying it to real-world data shown.

#!This paper presents a hybrid (geometry- & image-based) technique suitable for providing interactive walkthroughs of large, complex outdoor scenes. Motion is restricted along a smooth predefined path and the input to the system is a sparse set of stereoscopic views at certain points (key-positions) along that path (one view per position). An approximate local 3D model is constructed from each view, capable of capturing photometric and geometric properties of the scene only locally. Then during the rendering process, a continuous morphing (both photometric & geometric) takes place between successive local 3D models, using what we call a "morphable 3D-model". The morphing proceeds in a physically-valid way. For this reason, a wide-baseline image matching technique is proposed, handling cases where the wide baseline between the two images is mainly due to a looming of the camera. Our system can be extended in the event of multiple stereoscopic views (and therefore multiple local models) per key-position of the path (related by a camera rotation). In that case one local 3D-mosaic (per key-position) is constructed comprising all local 3D models therein and a "morphable 3D-mosaic" is used during the rendering process. A partial-differential equation is adopted to handle the problem of geometric consistency of each 3D-mosaic.

#!This paper describes a new algorithm that yields dense range maps in real-time.Reconstruction are based on a single frame structured light illumination.On-the-fly adaptation of the projection pattern renders the system more robust against scene variability. A continuous trade off between speed and quality is made. The correspondence problem is solved by using geometric pattern coding in combination with sparse color coding. Only local spatial and temporal continuity are assumed. This allows to construct a neighbor relationship within every frame and to track correspondences over time.All cues are integrated in one consistent labeling.This is achieved by reformulating the problem as a graph cut.Every cue is weighted based on its average consistency with the result within a small time window.Integration and weighting of additional cues is straightforward. The correctness of the range maps is not guaranteed, but an estimation of the uncertainty is provided for each part of the reconstruction.Our prototype is implemented using unmodified consumer hardware only.Frame rates vary between 10 and 25fps dependent on scene complexity.

#!Mutual information (MI) has shown promise as an effective stereo matching measure for images affected by radiometric distortion. This is due to the robustness of MI against changes in illumination. However, MI-based approaches are particularly prone to the generation of false matches due to the small statistical power of the matching windows. Consequently, most previous MI approaches utilise large matching windows which smooth the estimated disparity field. This paper proposes extensions to MI-based stereo matching in order to increase the robustness of the algorithm. Firstly, prior probabilities are incorporated into the MI measure in order to considerably increase the statistical power of the matching windows. These prior probabilities, which are calculated from the global joint histogram between the stereo pair, are tuned to a two level hierarchical approach. A 2D match surface, in which the match score is computed for every possible combination of template and matching window, is also utilised. This enforces left-right consistency and uniqueness constraints. These additions to MI-based stereo matching significantly enhance the algorithm's ability to detect correct matches while decreasing computation time and improving the accuracy. Results show that the MI measure does not perform quite as well for standard stereo pairs when compared to traditional area-based metrics. However, the MI approach is far superior when matching across multi-spectra stereo pairs.

#!Challenges related to viewpoint registration in rough forest terrain can be quite different compared to those faced in structured environments. Manoeuvring the sensor between measurement positions introduces large error into the a priori estimates of the registration coordinates. As a consequence, locally optimal registration methods may not work properly. Moreover, due to the clutter, the scene contents can change substantially even due to a relative small displacement of the sensor. Often, the sensor has to be moved to the other side of the target object, such as a group of trees, to get a good coverage of its geometry. In both cases, overlap between the two 3D data sets will be minimal ruling out conventional registration methods. In this paper, a feature-based method for registering 3D range scans for mapping natural outdoor environments is proposed. The method utilizes cylindrical, rotation symmetric features extracted from the 3D measurement data for viewpoint registration. The method is tested on real range images.

#!We present a progressive compression technique for volumetric subdivision meshes based on the slow growing refinement algorithm. The system is comprised of a wavelet transform followed by a progressive encoding of the resulting wavelet coefficients. We compare the efficiency of two wavelet transforms. The first transform is based on the smoothing rules used in the slow growing subdivision technique. The second transform is a generalization of lifted linear B-spline wavelets to the same multi-tier refinement structure. Direct coupling with a hierarchical coder produces progressive bit streams. Rate distortion metrics are evaluated for both wavelet transforms. We tested the practical performance of the scheme on synthetic data as well as data from laser indirect-drive fusion simulations with multiple fields per vertex. Both wavelet transforms result in high quality trade off curves and produce qualitatively good coarse representations.

#!Similarity measuring is a key problem for 3D model retrieval. In this paper, we propose a novel shape descriptor "Thickness Histogram" (TH) by uniformly estimating thickness of a model using statistical methods. It is translation and rotation-invariant, discriminative to different shapes, and very efficient to compute with the Shape Distribution (SD) proposed by Osada etc. For high performance of the retrieval, we propose a robust method for translating the directional form of the statistical distribution to the harmonic representation. By summing up energies at different frequencies, a matrix shape signature is formed to provide an exhaustive characterization of 3D geometry. Experiments show that the performance of the statistical harmonic representation is among the top ones of existing shape descriptors.

#!Image Compression has received a lot of interest over the years. Almost all the compression algorithms and standards, discussed in literature, gather statistics and compress on the complete image and compresses to suit various requirements such as lossy / lossless, baseline/progressive, spatial, region on interest. Natural images such as gray scale images and color images are best compressed in the existing literature based on the local and global properties such as attributes of constituent pixels of the given image. In this paper, it is proposed to quantize the amplitudes of pixel values to form a number of bit planes and these bit planes are transmitted in either lossy, lossless, progressive manner. Bit plane formation is attempted from the image acquiring stage to compress and then to transmission stage. Results obtained are promising and give rise to new method or ideology in image sensing, acquiring, storage and transmission.

#!Sonar profiling of the seabottom provide 3D data sets that can cover huge survey areas with many gaps. This paper describes a multiresolution framework or visualization pipeline that is being optimized for dealing with such data, taking into account both the CPU time and the user interactivity. This paper describes the techniques employed: (a) the construction of a quadtree that allows to eliminate gaps by interpolating available 3D data, (b) a first but coarse visualization at a high tree level in order to rapidly change or adjust the region of interest, and (c) a very efficient triangulation (mesh reduction) that allows for a fast interactivity even at the highest detail level. By using one single octree, all processing can be combined because (1) gaps can be filled by interpolation since they are smaller at higher tree levels, and (2) connected components can be projected down the tree and refined using the data available there. As a result, huge data sets can be visualized in near realtime on normally-sized discrete grids using shading instead of wire-frames, and this enables a fast searching for objects in the seabottom. Real CPU times are presented for a real sonar data set which is visualized at a low resolution, showing the overall shape of the seabottom, and at a high resolution, showing a (semi-)buried pipeline. In order to detect an object at such a high resolution additional techniques are applied to the data: (a) an interslice interpolation in order to cope with the increased data sparseness and (b) a maximum-homogeneity filtering in order to cope with the decreased signal-to-noise-ratio. After the extraction of the pipeline a thinning technique is applied in order to be able to quantify its length.

#!This paper describes how a photogrammetry based 3D capture system can be used as an input device for animation. The 3D Dynamic Capture System is used to capture the motion of a human face which is extracted from a sequence of 3D models captured at TV frame rate. Initially the positions of a set of landmarks on the face are extracted. These landmarks are then used to provide motion data in two different ways. First, a high level description of the movements are extracted, and these can be used as input to a procedural animation package (i.e. CreaToon). Second the landmarks can be used as registration points for a conformation process where the model to be animated is modified to match the captured model. This approach gives a new sequence of models which have the structure of the drawn model but the movement of the captured sequence.

#!Accurate and efficient optical flow estimation is a major step in many computational vision problems, including tracking and 2-D/3-D mapping applications. Processing of grayscale images has been the dominant approach, with only a few studies investigating selected aspects in the use of color imagery. In a physics-based analysis to study the impact of the spectral-dependent medium attenuation on the color channels, we have shown merit in the use of color cues in the computation of optical flow for underwater imagery-the primary motivation of the investigation [Robust optical flow estimation using underwater color images]. Comparisons among various color representations and traditional intensity component on the optical flow computation are given, suggesting that the HSV representation could be the most suitable. For both underwater and terrestrial imagery, even where data in the 3 color channels are highly correlated, one expects multiple constraints from color channels to give increased robustness due to the independent channel noises. Results of experiments are given to demonstrate improved localization and accuracy.

#!Data-driven approach is an appealing way to depict people in a virtual world. The captured shape and movement data from real people are structured and combined to reproduce or create new samples in an intuitive and controllable way. We focus on the body shape modeling and elucidate the issues related to data-driven methods. The difficulty of adopting data-driven approach for human body shape modeling is due in part to the intrinsic articulated structure of the body. Since such internal structure is not measured with most of existing capture devices available today, it has to be calculated through estimation. We develop a framework for collecting and managing range scan data that automatically estimates this structure from user-tagged landmarks. By framing the captured and structurally annotated data so that statistic implicit is exploited for synthesizing new body shapes, our technique support time-saving generation of animatable body models with high realism.

#!By reconstructing time-varying geometry one frame at a time, one ignores the continuity of natural motion, wasting useful information about the underlying video-image formation process and taking into account temporally discontinuous reconstruction results. In 4D spacetime, the surface of a dynamic object describes a continuous 3D hyper-surface. This hyper-surface can be implicitly defined as the minimum of an energy functional designed to optimize photo-consistency. Based on an Euler-Lagrange reformulation of the problem, we find this hyper-surface from a handful of synchronized video recordings. The resulting object geometry varies smoothly over time, and intermittently invisible object regions are correctly interpolated from previously and/or future frames.

#!Gridded volumetric data sets representing simulation or tomography output are commonly visualized by displaying a triangulated isosurface for a particular isovalue. When the grid is stored in a standard format, the entire volume must be loaded from disk, even though only a fraction of the grid cells may intersect the isosurface. We propose a compressed on-disk representation for regular volume grids that allows streaming, I/O-efficient, out-of-core isosurface extraction. Unlike previous methods, we provide a guaranteed bound on the ratio between the number of cells loaded and number of cells intersecting the isosurface that applies for any isovalue. As grid cells are decompressed, we immediately extract vertices and triangles of the isosurface. Our output is a coherent streaming mesh, which facilitates subsequent processing, including on-the-fly simplification and compression.

We solve this problem by iteratively fitting quadratic function to generate smoothly connected SDF. We analyzed the relationship between the quadratic coefficients and the surface curvature, and by using the coefficients, we evenly propagated the SDF so that it satisfies the constraints of the field. The proposed method was tested on synthetic data and real data that was generated by integrating multiple range images.

#!If several laboratories work in the same field and need to cooperate, it is necessary to exchange and mutually compare their computer results. The quick way to solve this problem is to unite their file formats (if it is practicable) or to install new software systems, which are data or file format compatible. A much better solution is to use only one common system. This article describes the architecture of a new client-server system, which offers possibilities of effective cooperation for laboratories doing the research in the field of the spatial organization of human genome. However, the system design is determined mainly by optical microscopy principles and therefore the system can easily be modified for use in other applications or environments. The most pressing problem during the system design was how to share and process large 3D image data in client-server architecture.

#!This paper deals with the problem of dense matching from stereo images under wide baseline conditions. By considering the characteristic properties of widely separated views, we propose an extension to a recently published algorithm for detailed reconstruction of continuous surfaces. The algorithm compensates for the occurrent affine distortion between the views to allow low level intensity based comparison necessary for dense matching. The matching itself is performed by an enhanced region rowing based affine propagation method that takes surface distortion into account to handle complex piecewise-smooth surfaces. It is experimentally shown that this new method can achieve smooth and accurate reconstruction from wide baseline images of both indoor and outdoor scenes. To quantify the reconstruction results we have created realistic synthetic datasets with ground truth. These datasets form the core of a future testbed for comparison of different wide baseline surface reconstruction techniques. In the current study, results on the synthetic images are compared to the ground truth to measure the accuracy of our method.

#!In this paper, we propose a viewer for huge point-sampled models by combining out-of-core technologies with view-dependent level-of-detail (LOD) control. This viewer is designed on the basis of a multiresolution data structure we have developed for gaze-guided visualization and transmission of 3D point sets. In order to reduce memory loads for huge point sets on general PC platforms, we introduce a partition-based out-of-core strategy to balance usage of main and external memories. At first, the data surface is partitioned into small blocks and points in each block are reorganized into error-controlled LODs by hierarchical clustering and LOD organization. In the interactive rendering process, a data block scheduling algorithm is used to realize the view-dependent paging. Experimental results show that the viewer can perform interactive visualization of huge point models on commodity graphics platforms with ease.

#!In this work, we present an adaptive space carving method for scene reconstruction from a set of images obtained from low cost calibrated webcams. Our method uses a combination of silhouette and photometric information to efficiently carve the shape of the observed scene out of a volumetric space represented by an octree data structure. In this method different resolutions are considered both in object space and in image space. This led us to adopt a strategy in which the information used by the photo-consistency test is registered in scene space by projective texture mapping. Another important question addressed in this work is the high level of noise present in low cost webcams. To deal with this problem we devised a statistical photo-consistency test that uses statistical estimators for the noise introduced by the sensors of the cameras.

#!We present a computational framework for the inference of dense descriptions from multiple view stereo with general camera placement. Thus far research on dense multiple view stereo has evolved along three axes: computation of scene approximations in the form of visual hulls; merging of depth maps derived from simple configurations, such as binocular or trinocular; and multiple view stereo with restricted camera placement. These approaches are either sub-optimal, since they do not maximize the use of available information, or cannot be applied to general camera configurations. Our approach does not involve binocular processing other than the detection of tentative pixel correspondences. We require calibration information for all cameras and that there exist camera pairs which enable automatic pixel matching. The inference of scene surfaces is based on the premise that correct pixel correspondences, reconstructed in 3-D, form salient, coherent surfaces, while wrong correspondences form less coherent structures. The tensor voting framework is suitable for this task since it can process the very large datasets we generate with reasonable computational complexity. We show results on real images that present numerous challenges.

We present a Montecarlo based iterative approach which, at every step, increases its knowledge about the scene sampling the unknown volume around the current estimation. Then, the samples which mostly appear to be consistent with the measurements are used to extend the mesh representing the surface. The reconstruction is regularized applying a filter -based on a dynamic system- to the mesh. This operation will preserve the high curvature areas of the surface, while smoothing away the noise in the estimation.

Initially, bi-directional 2D motion estimation is performed, which is followed by an efficient method for the reliable tracking of object contours. Rigid 3D motion and structure is recovered utilizing extended Kalman filtering. Finally, occlusions are dealt with a novel Bayesian framework, which exploits future information to correctly reconstruct occluded areas. Experimental evaluation shows that the layered object scene representation, combined with the proposed methods for object tracking throughout the sequence and occlusion handling, yields very accurate results.

#!Active contours and surfaces are deformable models used for 2D and 3D image segmentation. These models generally lack of convergence into boundary concavities, when segmenting highly concave objects. In this paper, we propose a method for exploring concavities, applicable on discrete active contours and surfaces deformed thanks to the greedy algorithm, which minimizes the energy functional. As a basis of this method, we introduce the gradient line energy (GLE), which goal is to make discrete parts of the surface coincide with boundaries, and the exploration force, computed from this energy, driving the surface into the object concavities. Our method lies on a general framework, enabling application on discrete 2D contours and 3D meshes with easy adaptation between both models.

#!This paper describes methods for segmenting planar surfaces from noisy 3D data obtained from correlation stereo vision. We make use of local planar surface elements called patchlets. Patchlets have 3D position, orientation and size parameters. As well, they have positional confidence measures based on the stereo sensor model. Patchlet orientations (i.e., surface normals) provide important additional dimensionality that reduces the ambiguity of segmentation-by-clustering. Patchlet size allows the use of continuity or coverage constraints when segmenting bounded surfaces from depth images. We use a region-growing approach to identify the number of surfaces that exist in a stereo image and obtain an initial estimate of the surface parameters. We refine segmentation using a maximum likelihood clustering approach that is optimised with Expectation-Maximisation. Confidence measures on the patchlet parameters allow proper weighting of patchlet contributions to the solution. We provide experimental results of the segmentation on complex outdoor scenes.

#!The purpose of this work is to synthesize textures of rough, real world surfaces under freely chosen viewing and illumination directions. Moreover, such textures are produced for continuously changing directions in such a way that the different textures are mutually consistent, i.e. emulate the same piece of surface. This is necessary for 3D animation. It is assumed that the mesostructure (small-scale) geometry of a surface is not known, and that the only input consists of a set of images, taken under different viewing and illumination directions. These are automatically aligned to build an appropriate Bidirectional Texture Function (BTF). Directly extending 2D synthesis methods for pixels to complete BTF columns has drawbacks which are exposed, and a superior sequential but highly parallelizable algorithm is proposed. Examples demonstrate the quality of the results.

#!The view-independent visualization of 3D scenes is most often based on rendering accurate 3D models or utilizes image-based rendering techniques. To compute the 3D structure of a scene from a moving vision sensor or to use image-based rendering approaches, we need to be able to estimate the motion of the sensor from the recorded image information with high accuracy, a problem that has been well-studied. In this work, we investigate the relationship between camera design and our ability to perform accurate 3D photography, by examining the influence of camera design on the estimation of the motion and structure of a scene from video data. By relating the differential structure of the time varying plenoptic function to different known and new camera designs, we can establish a hierarchy of cameras based upon the stability and complexity of the computations necessary to estimate structure and motion. At the low end of this hierarchy is the standard planar pinhole camera for which the structure from motion problem is non-linear and ill-posed. At the high end is a camera, which we call the full field of view polydioptric camera, for which the motion estimation problem can be solved independently of the depth of the scene which leads to fast and robust algorithms for 3D Photography. In between are multiple view cameras with a large field of view which we have built, as well as omni-directional sensors.

#!This paper gives a summary of automatic passive reconstruction of 3D scenes from images and video. Features are tracked between the images. Relative camera poses are then estimated based on the feature tracks. Both the feature tracking and the robust method used to estimate the camera poses has recently been shown to provide robust real-time performance. Given the camera poses, a more elaborate method is used to derive dense textured surfaces. The dense reconstruction method was originally part of the authors thesis [Automatic Dense Reconstruction from Uncalibrated Video Sequences]. It first computesdepth maps using graph cuts, optimizing a Bayesian formulation. The graph cut operation is used to let depth map hypotheses from various sources compete in order to optimize the cost function. The hypothesis generators used are feature based surface triangulation, plane fitting and multi-hypothesis multi-scale patch-based stereo. The requirements for a cost function to fit into the graph cut framework were already given in [Automatic Dense Reconstruction from Uncalibrated Video Sequences], along with a procedure for constructing the graph weights corresponding to any cost function that satisfies the requirements. Depth maps from many different viewpoints are then robustly fused to give a consistent global result using a process called median fusion. The robustness of the median fusion is important. It departs from the too common practice of fusing results by either using the union of free-space constraints as the resulting free-space, or the union of all predicted surfaces as the resulting surfaces, which is tremendously error-prone, since it essentially corresponds to taking either the minimum or maximum of the individual results.

#!This paper presents a framework for dynamic 3D shape and motion reconstruction from multi-viewpoint images using a deformable mesh model. By deforming a mesh at a frame to that at the next frame, we can obtain both 3D shape and motion of the object simultaneously. The deformation process of our mesh model is heterogeneous. Each vertex changes its deformation process according to its 1) photometric property (i.e., if it has prominent texture or not), and 2) physical property (i.e., if it is an element of rigid part of the object or not). This heterogeneous deformation model enables us to reconstruct the object which consists of different kinds of materials or parts with different motion models, e.g., rigidly acting body parts and deforming soft clothes or its skins, by a single and unified computational framework.

#!We examine the implications of shape on the process of finding dense correspondence and half-occlusions for a stereo pair of images. The desired property of the depth map is that it should be a piecewise continuous function which is consistent with the images and which has the minimum number of discontinuities. To zeroeth order, piecewise continuity becomes piecewise constancy. Using this approximation, we first discuss an approach for dealing with such a fronto-parallel shapeless world, and the problems involved therein. We then introduce horizontal and vertical slant to create a first order approximation to piecewise continuity. We highlight the fact that a horizontally slanted surface (ie. having depth variation in the direction of the separation of the two cameras) will appear horizontally stretched in one image as compared to the other image. Thus, while corresponding two images, N pixels on a scanline in one image may correspond to a different number of pixels M in the other image, which has consequences with regard to sampling and occlusion detection. We also discuss the asymmetry between vertical and horizontal slant, and the central role of non-horizontal edges in the context of vertical slant. Using experiments, we discuss cases where existing algorithms fail, and how the incorporation of new constraints provides correct results.

#!We propose an ICP-based registration method for range images that preserves fundamental features, i.e., local structures and color, of object surfaces. The method employs local surfaces as an attribute for establishing correspondences between range images where local surfaces are evaluated geometrically and photometrically. In estimating correspondences between range images, our method evaluates consistency of shape patterns and chromaticity of local surfaces together. In estimating transformation parameters relating the coordinates between different range images, on the other hand, our method evaluates skewness and chromaticity of correspondences. These two kinds of evaluation enhances accuracy of the estimation and results in preserving local structures and color of object surfaces.

Finally, the user selects some points of the 3D world and a smooth and safe motion path, which passes by these points, is created. The main assumption of the 3D modelling is that the animal could be divided into parts whose normal sections are ellipses. Joints and angles between skeleton points are used in order to decrease models complexity. Using the above methodology, a snake, a lizard and a goat are reconstructed.

Our method utilizes a new range imaging concept called multi-peak range imaging, which accounts for the effects of mutual reflections. False measurements generated by mutual reflections are then eliminated by applying a series of constraint tests based on local smoothness, global coordinate consistency and visibility consistency. We show the usefulness of our method by applying the method to three real objects with specular surfaces. The ground truth data for those three objects were also acquired in order to evaluate the elimination of false measurements and to justify the selection of the parameters in the constraint tests. Experimental results indicate that our method significantly improves upon the traditional methods for constructing reliable 3D models of specular objects with complex shapes.

#!Nowadays image motion analysis is considered as a significant subject in image processing and according to its characteristics is divided into different categories. This paper focuses on camera jitter as fast translations in image sequence due to an unstable platform. Our studies have led to do correlation matching [Motion Displacement Estimation Using an Affine Modelfor Image Matching] between well featured templates[Edge Detection using KL Transform, Extracting Good Features for Motion Estimation] of successive frames to prevent aperture problems and thus have good estimation of the translations. But camera vibration may also suffer from rotation and scaling as nonlinear motions [Detection of Non-Uniform Motion in Image Sequences using a Reduced Order Likelihood Ratio Test] that may defect thematching process. Therefore mapping of 3D image points into camera image plane has been investigated to trace the effects of these nonlinear parameters in 2D motion equations [Image Based Measurement Systems]. Now by approximating these equations for minute rotation and bounded scaling between frame i and i+1, the set of motion equations with four unknowns (rotation, scaling, horizontal /vertical translations) could be solved just by LSE [Kalman Filtering, Theory and Practice using MATLAB] method for a unique and optimized response. After all when you apply the estimated displacements on each frame for compensation, an stabilized sequence will conclude.

#!We introduce the concept of "surface illuminance flow" in two steps.First we reiterate the notion of the "light vector", then we proceed to decompose the light vector into a scalar "normal illuminance" and a vector "surface illuminance flow".The scalar normal illuminance generates the familiar illuminance pattern that is often known as the "shading".The vector surface illuminance flow is irrelevant for smooth surfaces (which probably explains why it is conventionally ignored) but it generates the texture due to surface mesorelief.We show how observation of the illuminance induced texture leads to robust inferences of the surface illuminance flow direction modulo 180°. This makes surface illuminance flow a property that is observable in natural scenes.Muchl ike optical flow, the surface illuminance flow is largely due to a global property that exists independent of local structure, namely the direction of the general illuminating beam (sunlight or light from the overcast sky in a typical outdoors scene).However, due to the fact that there exists "true screening" in radiometry (thus removing any hope for a "field theory" of radiometry) the local scene structure has an influence on the local light field.Such "vignetting" is a main cause of the complexity of radiometry, the other cause being the ever present multiple scatterings.This complicates matters but also introduces additional sources of information.We illustrate instances of the observation of illuminance flow in scenes.We also present a data base of roughly spherical objects, illuminated in a number of standard ways that we have used to study illuminance flow over actual rough objects.

#!It is well known that many surfaces exhibit reflectance that is not well modelled by Lambert's law. This is the case not only for surfaces that are rough or shiny, but also those that are matte and composed of materials that are particle suspensions. As a result, standard Lambertian shape-from-shadingmethods can not be applied directly to the analysis of rough and shiny surfaces. In order to overcome this difficulty, in this paper, weconsider how to reconstruct the Lambertian component for rough and shiny surfaceswhen the object is illuminated in the viewing direction. To do this we make use of the diffuse reflectance models described by Oren and Nayar, and by Wolff. Our experiments with synthetic and real-world data reveal the effectiveness of the correction method, leading to improved surface normal and height recovery.

#!This paper describes an empirical investigation of departures from Lambert's law for rough and shiny surfaces. We commence by using a recently reported method to recover estimates ofthe surface radiance function for objects illuminated in the viewer direction. This method is non-parametric, and offers the advantage that it is simple to use since it does not require detailed camera calibration. We compare the radiance data with a number of phenomenological and physics-basedreflectance models. The models studied include those of Oren-Nayar, Wolff and different variants of the Beckmann model. The main conclusion of the study is that among these models the best fit to the empirical data is found to be the Wolff model for smooth objects and the modified Beckmann model for rough objects.

#!Image based rendering (IBR) consists of several steps: (i) Calibration (or ego-motion computation) of all input images. (ii) Determination of regions in the input images used to synthesize the new view. (iii) Interpolating the new view from the selected areas of the input images. We propose a unified representation for all these aspects of IBR using the Space-Time (x-y-t) volume. The presented approach is very robust, and allows to use IBR in general conditions even with a hand-held camera. To take care of (i), the Space-Time volume is constructed by placing frames at locations along the time axis so that image features create straight lines in the EPI (epipolar plane images). Different slices of the Space-Time volume are used to produce new views, taking care of (ii). Step (iii) is done by interpolating between image samples using the feature lines in the EPI images. IBR Examples are shown for various cases: sequences taken from a driving car, from a hand held camera, or when using a tripod.

#!Manual indexing of large databases of geometric information is costly and often impracticable. Because of this research into retrieval and indexing schemes has focused on the development of various 3D to 2D mappings that characterise a shape as a histogram with a small number of parameters. Many methods of generating such 2D signatures (i.e. histograms) have been proposed, generally based on geometric measures of say curvature or distance. However these geometric signatures lack information about topology and tend to become indistinct as the complexity of the shape increases. This paper describes a new method for characterising both the geometry and topology of shapes in a single 2D graph, the Surface Partitioning Spectrum (SPS). We evaluate the effectiveness of using the SPS with a Neural Network to assess the similarity of shapes within a test set.

#!We propose a depth scaling method that enables visualization of arbitrary-shaped 3D scenes on 3D displays.Most current 3D displays have a depth limitation, while the scene to be displayed has not.The trivial solutions as clipping or linear scaling of the scene's 3D bounding box suffer from non-optimal utilization of the display's capabilities. Our approach uses spatially adaptive depth scaling that maximizes the perceptual 3D effect.From the original scene geometry, the topology and local depth ordering among objects are preserved, while depth linearity is disregarded. The scaling method applies to nearly all 3D displays, such as glasses-based, head-tracked, multi-view, holographic and volumetric 3D displays.Subjective tests with the Dynamic Dimension display system show that our method significantly increases the perceptual 3D effect.

#!This paper describes a simple method for estimating the surface radiance function from single images of smooth surfaces made of materials whose reflectance function is isotropic and monotonic. The method makes implicit use of the Gauss map between the surface and a unit sphere. We assume that the material brightness is monotonic with respect to the angle between the illuminant direction and the surface normal. Under conditions in which the light source and the viewer directions are identical, we show how a tabular representation of the surface radiance function can be estimated using the cumulative distribution of image gradients. Using this tabular representation of the radiance function, surfaces may be rendered under varying light source direction by rotating the corresponding reflectance map on the Gauss sphere about the specular spike direction. We present a sensitivity study on synthetic and real-world imagery. We also present two applications which make use of the estimated radiance function. The first of these illustrates how the radiance function estimates can be used to render objects when the light and viewer directions are no longer coincident. The second application involves applying corrected Lambertian radiance to rough and shiny surfaces.

#!This paper makes two contributions to the problem of shape-from-shading. First, we develop a new method for surface normal recovery. We pose the problem as that of solving the steady state heat equation subject to the hard constraint that Lambert's law is satisfied. According to this picture, the surface normals are found by taking the gradient of a scalar field. The heat equation for the scalar field can be solved using simple finite difference methods and leads to an iterative procedure for surface normal estimation. The second contribution is to show how surface height recovery from the field of surface normals can be posed as one of low dimensional embedding. We experiment with the resulting method on a variety of real-world image data, where it produces qualitatively good reconstructed surfaces.

The technique is efficient in space and time, and results in significantly fewer outlier estimates while more broadly offering accuracy comparable to existing methods. It generalizes naturally to computing derivatives of curvature and higher-order surface differentials.

We propose a novel scheme of interactive modeling of free-form lambertian surfaces where the solution obtained is consistent with the Shape from Shading model. To this end, a reinforcement learning based scheme has been adopted which allows user intervention at any stage of the algorithm to guide the SFS solution to a global minimum.

Finally, a histogram of distances is computed for each one of these orientations; it will be used to define the position of the projection planes as well as the corresponding clipping planes. The original panoramic range image is divided into as many planar projections as main directions in the orientation histograms are extracted. This technique can be used with both indoor and outdoor scenes. Experimental result with a panoramic range image is presented.

#!This paper presents an hybrid segmentation technique that combines both the speed of an edge based approach with the robustness of a surface based approach. It consists of three stages. In the first stage a scan line approximation process extracts the edges contained into the given range image. These edges are later on used to define the positions of seed points. Through the second stage a two steps region growing technique is applied. First a 2D growing process enlarges the original seed points generating bigger regions. Next, each region is fitted to a plane and a cylinder. The one that best fit the given points is selected to represent that region and used during the 3D growing stage. The 3D growing stage is carried out taking into account the approximation error from candidate points to be added to the fitted surface. In this way, each surface is grown until no points can be added according to a user defined threshold. Finally, in the third stage, a post-processing algorithm merges neighbour regions that belong to the same surface. Experimental results by using industrial environments are presented.

The first stage detects peaks and valleys of points' trajectories, which are used on the second stage to discern whether the movement corresponds to a walking or a running displacement. Prior knowledge of human body kinematics structure together with the corresponding motion model are the basis for the motion recognition. Experimental results with different video sequences are presented.

#!Many model editing operations, such as morphing, blending, and shape deformation, require the ability to interactively transform the surface of a model in response to some control mechanism. For most computer graphics applications, it is important to preserve the local shape properties of input models during editing operations. Our work introduces the first, to our knowledge, mesh editing technique that explicitly preserves local shape properties. The method is based on a local shape representation, which we refer to as pyramid coordinates. The pyramid coordinates capture the local shape of the mesh around each vertex and help maintain this shape under various editing operations. They are based on a set of angles and lengths relating a vertex to its immediate neighbors. This representation is invariant under rigid transformations. Using pyramid coordinates, we introduce a new technique for mesh deformation and morphing based on a small number of user-specified control vertices. Our algorithm generate natural looking deformations and morphing sequences in seconds with minimal user interaction.

#!Recent progress in digitizing technologies is making it possible to capture the 3D shapes of moving objects. To efficiently utilize time series records of spatial data, the information must be unified to yield coherent deforming models. This paper presents a general method that unifies unregistered 3D point sequences to generate deforming mesh models. The method does not assume any specific kinematic structure, and is applicable to any digitizer. The method first polygonizes the initial points and then deforms meshes to best fit the subsequent data points while minimizing the deformation energy. Experiments are conducted on real measured data and CG data, and successful results are obtained. As an application of the method, we examine data compression and achieve a 380 fold reduction rate for a measured data sequence.

#!We present an approach for automatic reconstruction of a dynamic event using multiple video cameras recording from different viewpoints. Those cameras do not need to be calibrated or even synchronized. Our approach recovers all the necessary information by analyzing the motion of the silhouettes in the multiple video streams. The first step consists of computing the calibration and synchronization for pairs of cameras. We compute the temporal offset and epipolar geometry using an efficient RANSAC-based algorithm to search for the epipoles as well as for robustness. In the next stage the calibration and synchronization for the complete camera network is recovered and then refined through maximum likelihood estimation. Finally, a visual-hull algorithm is used to the recover the dynamic shape of the observed object. For unsynchronized video streams silhouettes are interpolated to deal with subframe temporal offsets. We demonstrate the validity of our approach by obtaining the calibration, synchronization and 3D reconstruction of a moving person from a set of 4 minute videos recorded from 4 widely separated video cameras.

This allows images of a face to be synthesised under novel lighting, pose and skin reflectance given only one example image. We exploit facial symmetry by reflecting the needle-map of a rotated face to yield the needle-map of the face rotated in the opposite direction. This provides two needle-maps between which interpolation can be performed.

#!Looking around in our every day environment, many of the encountered objects are specular to some degree. Actively using this fact when reconstructing objects from image sequences is the scope of the shape from specularities problem. One reason why this problem is important is that standard structure from motion techniques fail when the object surfaces are specular. Here this problem is addressed by estimating surface shape using information from the specular reflections. A specular reflection gives constraints on the surface normal. The approach taken in this paper differs significantly from many earlier shape from specularities methods since the normal data used is sparse. The main contribution of this paper is to give a solid foundation for shape from specularities problems. Estimation of surface shape using reflections is formulated as a variational problem and the surface is represented implicitly using a level set formulation. A functional incorporating all surface constraints is proposed and the corresponding level set motion PDE is explicitly derived. This motion is then proven to minimize the functional. As a part of this functional a variational approach to normal alignment is proposed and analyzed. Also novel methods for implicit surface interpolation to sparse point sets are presented together with a variational analysis. Experiments on both real and synthetic data support the proposed method.

#!In this paper the problem of building and reconstructing geometrical surface models from multiple calibrated images is considered. We build an appropriate statistical 3D model from the images alone and show how this a priori model can be used to automatically reconstruct new instances of the object category from one or several images. The surface reconstruction method is based on a level set representation and one of the main novel contributions lie within the level set framework. Standard methods use either image-correlation or point correspondences to achieve this goal. We show how this framework can be extended to incorporate image curves and apparent contours (i.e. the projections of silhouettes). In order to automatically obtain feature correspondences, we use a statistical shape modelfor the object category of interest. The model is based on the Active Shape Model using Probabilistic PCA. The scheme is applied to build and automatically reconstruct 3D surface models of faces. The resulting system is demonstrated on a database of real face images.

#!This paper describes an efficient 3D modeling method from 3D range data-sets that is utilizing range data segmentation. Our algorithm starts with a set of unregistered 3D range scans of a large scale scene. The scans are being pre-processed for noise removal and hole filling. The next step is range segmentation and the extraction of planar and linear features. These features are utilized for the automatic registration of the range scans into a common frame of reference [Automated feature-based range registration of urban scenes of large scale]. A volumetric-based algorithm is used for the construction of a coherent 3D mesh that encloses all range scans. Finally, the original segmented scans are used in order to simplify the constructed mesh. The mesh can now be represented as a set of planar regions at areas of low complexity and as a set of dense mesh triangular elements at areas of high complexity. This is achieved by computing the overlaps of the original segmented planar areas on the generated 3D mesh. The example of the construction of the 3D model of a building in the NYC area is presented.

Thus static features such as object color, shape, and contours cannot be used for image matching. In this paper a different method is proposed for matching partially overlapping images captured by such cameras. The matching is achieved by calculation of co-motion statistics, followed by detection and rejection of points outside the overlap area and a nonlinear optimization process. The robust algorithm we describe finds point correspondences in two images without searching for any structures and without the need for tracking continuous motion. Trials using statistical motion-based image cross-registration, a robust rejection algorithm, and automatic 3D image-transformation and camera calibration on real-life outdoor images have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach.

#!In this paper, a new technique for 3D acoustic image segmentation and modelling is proposed. Especially, in the underwater environment, in which optical sensors suffer from visibility problems, the acoustical devices may provide efficient solutions, but, on the other hand, acoustic image interpretation is surely more difficult for a human operator. The proposed application involves the use of an acoustic camera which directly acquires images structured as a set of 3D points. Due to the noisy nature of this type of data, the segmentation problem becomes more challenging and the standard algorithms for range image segmentation are likely to fail. The proposed method is based on a simplified version of the so called recover and select paradigm in which the seed areas, from which the segmentation starts, are generated by adopting a robust approach based on the RANSAC (RANdom Sample And Consensus) algorithm. Superquadric primitives are directly recovered from raw data without any pre-segmentation processing. Experimental trials using both synthetic and real acoustical images confirm the goodness of the method, and a large robustness of the resulting segmented images, associated to a relatively low computational load.

#!This paper proposes an omnidirectional-to-panoramic image transform with high accuracy using PDE-based resampling models. For the application of computer-vision techniques to omnidirectional images, the transformation of omnidirectional images to uniform-resolution quadric-surface images is needed in the two reasons. First, an omni-directional image does not have a uniform resolution. Second, the development of the computer-vision-based techniques on the quadric surface is mathematically accurate compared with the development of the techniques on the omnidirectional image directly. Therefore, our aim is to generate uniform-resolution panoramic images on cylindrical surface from nonuniform-resolution omnidirectional images. The uniform-resolution panoramic images allow us to reconstruct 3D objects and scenes from omnidirectional images robustly. Our panoramic transformation selects the uniform resolution pixels on omnidirectional images employing the geometrical configuration of cameras in the estimation and resampling process. Therefore, our method is mathematically accurate comparing to the traditional panoramic transformation using point-to-point correspondences with the geometries of cameras and the cubic convolution.

#!Finding correspondences between two (widely) separated views is essential for several computer vision tasks, such as structure and motion estimation and object recognition. In the wide-baseline matching using scale and/or affine invariant features the search for correspondences typically proceeds in two stages. In the first stage a putative set of correspondences is obtained based on distances between feature descriptors. In the second stage the matches are refined by imposing global geometric constraints by means of robust estimation of the epipolar geometry and the incorrect matches are rejected as outliers. For a feature in one view, usually only one "best" feature (the nearest neighbor) in the other view is chosen as corresponding feature, despite the fact that several match candidates exist. In this paper, we will consider multiple candidate matches for each feature, and integrate this choice with the robust estimation stage, thus avoiding the early commitment to the "best" one. This yields a generalized RANSAC framework for identifying the true correspondences among sets of matches. We examine the effectiveness of different sampling strategies for sets of correspondences and test the approach extensively using real examples of hard correspondence problems caused by a large motion between views and/or ambiguities due to repetitive scene structures.

#!An appearance-based face authentication system integrating 2D color or intensity images and 3D data is presented in this paper. The proposed system is based on a low-cost 3D and color sensor, capable of synchronous real-time acquisition of 3D images and associated color images. Novel algorithms are proposed that exploit depth information and prior knowledge of face geometry and symmetry to achieve robust face detection, localization and authentication under conditions of background clutter, occlusion, face pose alteration and harsh illumination. A method for the enrichment of face databases with synthetically generated views depicting variations in pose and illumination is proposed to cope with head rotations and illumination variations, avoiding a cumbersome enrolment process. The performance of the proposed authentication scheme is tested thoroughly on a face database of 1500 images, recorded with the 3D acquisition system. Experimental results demonstrate significant gains resulting from the combined use of depth and color or intensity information, in comparison to the use of 2D images alone.

#!Interactive 3D modeling is the process of building a 3D model of an object or a scene in real-time while the 3D (range) data is acquired. This is possible only if the computational complexity of all involved algorithms is linear with respect to the amount of data. We propose a new framework for 3D modeling where a complete modeling chain meets with this requirement. The framework is based on the use of vector fields as an implicit surface representation. Each modeling step, registration, surface reconstruction, geometric fusion, compression and visualization is solved and explained using the vector fields without anyintermediate representations. The proposed framework allows model reconstruction from any type of 3D data, surface patches, curves, unorganized sets of points or a combination of these.

#!Range image registration and surface reconstruction have been traditionally considered as two independent processes where the latter relies on the results of the former. This paper presents a new approach to surface recovery from range images where the two processes are unified and performed in a common volumetric representation. While the reconstructed surface is described in its implicit form as a signed distance field within a volume, registration information for matching partial surfaces is encoded in the same volume as the gradient of the distance field. This allows coupling of both reconstruction and registration and leads to an algorithm whose complexity is linear with respect to the number of images and the number of measured 3D points. The close integration and performance gain improve interactivity in the process of modeling from range image acquisition to surface reconstruction. The distances computed in the direction of filtered normals improve robustness while preserving the sharp details of the initial range images. It is shown that the integrated algorithm is tolerant to initial registration errors as well as to measurement errors. The paper describes the representation and formalizes the approach. Experimental results demonstrate performance advantages and tolerance to aforementioned types of errors.

#!It is well known that the epipolar geometry between two uncalibrated perspective views is completely encapsulated in the fundamental matrix. Since the fundamental matrix has seven degrees of freedom (DOF), self-calibration is possible if at most seven of the intrinsic or extrinsic camera parameters are unknown by extracting them from the fundamental matrix. This paper presents a linear algorithm for self-calibrating a perspective camera which undergoes fixation, that is, a special motion in which the camera's optical axis is confined in a plane. Since this fixation has four degrees of freedom, which is one smaller than that of general motion, we can extract at most three intrinsic parameters from the fundamental matrix. We here assume that the focal length (1 DOF) and the principal point (2 DOF) are unknown but fixed for two views. It will be shown that these three parameters are obtained from the fundamental matrix in an analytical fashion and a closed-form solution is derived. We also characterize all the degenerate motions under which there exists an infinite set of solutions.

Polygonal models which are widely utilized in the modeling of 3-D objects are taken as basis, making use of the polygonal structure and vertex coordinates for the display of 3-D models. The amount of polygons and vertices of a model is proportional to the resolution as well as data quantity. In other words the resolution and data increases with the number of polygons. In this paper, it is proposed to utilize resolution, and hence data amount, adjustable 3-D modeling so that model resolution and transmitted data amount can be regulated according to access constraints.

#!We propose a new data structure, called Fan-Meshes (FM), for reconstructing 3D models and scenes represented by dense scanning point clouds. It is a local piecewise linear approximation to the data geometry, and can serve as primitives in reconstruction with a good balance between computational loads and reconstruction quality. In our algorithm, local remeshing is performed in preprocessing to obtain regular FMs, and a three-level-point data structure called Triangle Selection Record (TSR) is then used to reduce redundancies in the raw data and overlapping in the original FMs. Furthermore, to apply the method to raw 3D scanning data, we use a smoothing operator to the point cloud in order to eliminate some sensor noises. Experimental results demonstrate that our scheme is effective even for large-scale scenes with real data.

#!This paper presents a framework for speech-driven synthesis of real faces from a corpus of 3D video of a person speaking.Video-rate capture of dynamic 3D face shape and colour appearance provides the basis for a visual speech synthesis model.A displacement map representation combines face shape and colour into a 3D video.This representation is used to efficiently register and integrate shape and colour information captured from multiple views.To allow visual speech synthesis viseme primitives are identified from the corpus using automatic speech recognition. A novel non-rigid alignment algorithm is introduced to estimate dense correspondence between 3D face shape and appearance for different visemes.The registered displacement map representation together with a novel optical flow optimisation using both shape and colour, enables accurate and efficient non-rigid alignment.Face synthesis from speech is performed by concatenation of the corresponding viseme sequence using the non-rigid correspondence to reproduce both 3D face shape and colour appearance. Concatenative synthesis reproduces both viseme timing and co-articulation.Face capture and synthesis has been performed for a database of 51 people.Results demonstrate synthesis of 3D visual speech animation with a quality comparable to the captured video of a person.

#!In this paper, we present a new algorithm for reconstructing an environment from images recorded by multiple calibrated cameras. Multiple camera systems challenge traditional stereo algorithms in many issues including view registration, selection of commonly visible image parts for matching, and the fact that surfaces are imaged differently from different viewpoints and poses. On the other hand, multiple cameras have the advantage of revealing surfaces at occluding contours and covering wide areas. The presented algorithm makes no assumption on camera loci and outputs an occupancy voxel grid, with occupied voxels being accompanied by a surface normal. It is correlation-based, however, outperforms the conventional correlation-based approach in reconstruction quality. It is highly parallelizable, and most importantly, is robust against artifacts due to camera registration errors that are typically encountered when using multiple cameras.

#!Interactive network-based navigation over large urban environments raises difficult problems due to the size and complexity of these scenes. In this paper, we present a clientserver system allowing navigation over 3D cities in real time. Due to a novel progressive and hierarchical representation of 3D models of densely built urban areas, only perceptible details for all the regions visible from a given viewpoint are progressively streamed to visualisation clients. Furthermore, efficient coding methods are used to compress the representation data allowing quick start-up of the interactive visualisation with a highly-detailed model. This is achieved through a set of dedicated algorithms allowing a very large city model to be structured into a multi-resolution representation. The method efficiently exploits the fact that most automated modelling techniques of urban scenes provides 2D\frac{1} {2} models (building footprint, height, altitude, ...). So as to efficiently and faithfully model complex buildings, a procedural representation for roofs and facades is proposed. Finally, we present an MPEG4 compatible implementation based on the introduction of new node types with the associated bitstream.

The 2D images guide the filling using the relationship between the images and geometry learned from the existing 3D scanned data. Our method builds on existing techniques for using scanned geometry and for estimating shape from shaded images. Rather than creating plausibly filled holes, we attempt to approximate the missing geometry. We present results for scanned data from both triangulation and time-of-flight scanners for various types of materials. To quantitatively validate our proposed method, we also compare the filled areas with ground-truth data.

The main idea for an efficient implementation of this dynamic programming approach is a recursive scheme to calculate the min-convolution in a manner suitable for the parallel stream computation model of graphics processing units. Since many image similarity functions can be efficiently calculated by modern graphics hardware, it is reasonable to address the final disparity extraction by graphics processors as well. Our timing results indicate that the proposed approach is beneficial for larger image resolutions and disparity ranges in particular.

#!An important task in the analysis and reconstruction of curvilinear structures from unorganized 3-D point samples is the estimation of tangent information at each data point. Its main challenges are in (1) the selection of an appropriate scale of analysis to accommodate noise, density variation and sparsity in the data, and in (2) the formulation of a model and associated objective function that correctly expresses their effects. We pose this problem as one of estimating the neighborhood size for which the principal eigenvector of the data scatter matrix is best aligned with the true tangent of the curve, in a probabilistic sense. We analyze the perturbation on the direction of the eigenvector due to finite samples and noise using the expected statistics of the scatter matrix estimators, and employ a simple iterative procedure to choose the optimal neighborhood size. Experiments on synthetic and real data validate the behavior predicted by the model, and show competitive performance and improved stability over leading polynomial-fitting alternatives that require a preset scale.

#!We present a 3D reconstruction and modeling system that operates on a number of input photographs that show a natural scene. Approaches from computer graphics and image processing are combined and performance is shown via experiments. Furthermore, reconstruction quality is analyzed w.r.t. the number and distribution of textures, used for reconstruction. The reconstruction pipeline starts with image acquisition, which consists of a number of photographs of the scene that are sequentially taken at different positions. Since the photographs are not acquired concurrently, they are influenced by different illumination conditions that we mandate to be preserved in the final 3D representation. In the second step, object segmentation is applied and camera calibration provided. This allows the application of shape-from-silhouette approaches, namely a hierarchical voxel approach, where different resolution layers are organized within an octree structure. For applying texture mapping, the voxel model is transformed into a wireframe, which provides smoothing of the object's surface and also reduces the number of surface primitives. Finally, a subset of original images is mapped onto the 3D geometry to provide texture information. Here, view-adaptive multi-texturing is used to preserve natural illumination. Intermediate views are interpolated automatically using adaptive real-time weight calculations for original textures.

#!We recently proposed a new and efficient next-best-view algorithm for 3D reconstruction of indoor scenes using active range sensing. We overcome the computation difficulty of evaluating the view metric function by using an adaptive hierarchical approach to exploit the various spatial coherences inherent in the acquisition constraints and quality requirements. The impressive speedups have allowed our NBV algorithm to become the first to be able to exhaustively evaluate a large set of 3D views with respect to a large set of surfaces, and to include many practical acquisition constraints and quality requirements. The success of the algorithm is greatly dependent on the implementation efficiency of the constraint and quality evaluations. In this paper, we describe the algorithmic details of the hierarchical view evaluation, and present efficient algorithms that evaluate sensing constraints and surface sampling densities between a view volume and a surface patch instead of simply between a single view point and a surface point. The presentation here provides examples for the design of efficient algorithms for new sensing constraints.

#!We present a modular system for real-time 3D-scanning of human bodies under motion. The high-resolution shape and colour appearance is captured by several scanning units positioned around the object of interest. Each of these units performs a foreground-background segmentation and computes a valid depth-range for the spatially neighbouring units. Multiple depth-ranges are combined in a visual hull representation, which limits the search-range for the 3D-reconstruction. Depth-estimation is based on a hierarchical mult-view-stereo plane sweep approach. Robustness and accuracy is increased by incorporating imperceptible infrared illumination as well as adding local pixel gradient information. All parts of the processing pipeline, involving camera color conversions, segmentation, depth-range computation, visual-hull generation, lossless image compression, network transfer of the infrared and colour images, and the plane sweep algorithm, are implemented on the GPU and highly optimized for speed, allowing scanning times of less than 40ms per frame. Experimental results demonstrate the applicability of our system to the creation of high-density on-line digital doubles.

#!We present a stereo algorithm that achieves high quality results while maintaining real-time performance. The key idea is simple: we introduce an adaptive aggregation step in a dynamic-programming (DP) stereo framework. The per-pixel matching cost is aggregated in the vertical direction only. Compared to traditional DP, our approach reduces the typical "streaking" artifacts without the penalty of blurry object boundaries. Evaluation using the benchmark Middlebury stereo database shows that our approach is among the best (ranked first in the new evaluation system) for DP-based approaches. The performance gain mainly comes from a computationally expensive weighting scheme based on color and distance proximity. We utilize the vector processing capability and parallelism in commodity graphics hardware to speed up this process over two orders of magnitude. Over 50 million disparity evaluations per second (MDE/s)1 are achieved in our current implementation.

#!The spherical harmonic (SPHARM) description is a powerful surface modeling technique that can model arbitrarily shaped but simply connected three dimensional (3D) objects. Because SPHARM based 3D models can derive functional information analysis and classify different pathological symptoms, it has been used in many applications in biomedical image computing. There is an urgent requirement for efficient spatio-temporal shape modeling to represent the dynamic anatomical structures in many applications (e.g., medical image analysis, geospatial information systems). In this paper we propose a novel real spherical harmonics based spatio-temporal shape modeling method to efficiently and flexibly represent the shapes sequence of anatomical structures in medical images. Our method works well on the simply connected 3D objects and the effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through theoretic and experimental exploration of a set of medical image applications. Furthermore, an evaluation criterion for spatio-temporal shape modeling efficiency is proposed and the comparison results showed the good performance of our method.

#!In this paper, the depth cue due to the assumption of texture uniqueness is reviewed. The spatial direction over which a similarity measure is optimized, in order to establish a stereo correspondence, is considered and methods to increase the precision and accuracy of stereo reconstructions are presented. An efficient implementation of the above methods is offered, based on optimizations that evaluate potential correspondences hierarchically, in the spatial and angular dimensions. Furthermore, the expansion of the above techniques in a multi-view framework where calibration errors cause the misregistration of individually obtained reconstructions are considered, and a treatment of the data is proposed for the elimination of duplicate reconstructions of a single surface point. Finally, a processing step is proposed for the increase of reconstruction precision and post-processing of the final result. The above contributions are integrated in a generic and parallelizable implementation of the uniqueness constraint to observe speedup and increase in the fidelity of surface reconstruction.

#!Motivated by the requirements of modern archaeologists, we are developing a documentation system based on structured light for acquisition of ceramics. Fragments of ceramics are daily finds at excavations and important for archaeological research, because their shape leads to information about ancient cultures. The shapes used for documentation are called profile lines and estimated by a vertical cross-section of orientated fragments. As ceramics have been produced using rotational plates for several thousands of years, the rotational axis can be used for orientation. Therefore we conducted experiments using existing methods for estimation of the rotational axis. The drawbacks of these methods are the requirement of either complete objects or industrialized quality of symmetry. Therefore we show a new method using circle templates, which has been inspired by the manual method of archaeologists. In this work we present results using previous and related work in comparison with the estimation of the rotational axis using circle templates. The results of the presented methods are shown for synthetic data, well-known fragments and real data acquired at an archaeological excavation. Finally a conclusion and an outlook is given.

#!Oil and gas exploration decisions are made based on inferences obtained from seismic data interpretation. The interpretation task is getting very time-consuming as seismic data sets become larger. Image processing tools such as auto-trackers assist manual interpretation of horizons-visible boundaries between certain sediment layers in seismic data. Auto-trackers assume data continuities; therefore, their assistance is very limited in areas of discontinuities such as faults. In this paper, we present a method for automatic horizon matching across faults based on a Bayesian approach. A stochastic matching model which integrates 3d spatial information of seismic data and prior geological knowledge is introduced. The optimal matching solution is found by MAP estimate of this model. A simulated annealing with reversible jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm is employed to sample from a-posteriori distribution. The model was applied to real 3d seismic data, and has shown to produce geologically acceptable horizons matchings.

#!This paper extends the idea of classification schemes for static surface curvature into the temporal domain. We seek to identify regions in sequences of depth data that exhibit variations in shape change, and to characterise the nature of the deformation. From observing the change in principle curvatures we show how it is possible to decouple the type of change into one of fifteen classes, and also reveal the extent of alteration. Results are presented for synthetic and real data sequences, with additional alignment performed to accommodate global motion. This technique shows promise in analysing data from video-rate range sensors, with potential applications in biometric and psychological analysis of the face and other deformable objects.

#!3D scanning techniques based on structured light usually achieve robustness against outliers by performing multiple projections to simplify correspondence. However, for cases such as dynamic scenes, the number of frames captured from a certain view must be kept as low as possible, which makes it difficult to reconstruct complex scenes with high frequency shapes and inappropriate reflection properties. To tackle this problem, we present a novel set of color stripe patterns and a robust correspondence algorithm that assume local spatial coherence in the captured data. This assumption allows us to design our stripe sequences with globally unique neighborhood properties to effectively avoid wrong correspondences. The concept of local spatial coherence is further exploited to make the ensuing surface reconstruction practically insensitive to noise, outliers, and anisotropic sampling density. Thus, the recovery of a topologically consistent manifold surface can be drastically simplified. We have successfully generated high quality meshes of various colored objects using a minimalistic projector-camera system. In particular, the full sampling capabilities of our devices can be exhausted by taking only three shots.

#!Object recognition in 3D scenes with occlusion means identifying an incomplete and unknown object, which is arbitrarily posed, in an object database. This hard computer vision problem is solved in this paper through a new 3D shape representation called Depth Gradient Image Based on Silhouette (DGI-BS). DGI-BS can be used to obtain a complete model as well as a partial model of an object. This property allows us to use it in complex scenes where incomplete surfaces of objects are available. The complete DGI-BS version synthesizes surface information (through depth image) and shape information (through contour) of the whole object in a single image smaller than 1 mega pixel. Object recognition is carried out by means of a simple matching algorithm in the DGI-BS space which yields a correspondence point-to-point between scene and model. This method has been successfully tested in real scenes with no special restrictions using range sensors.

#!In this paper, we propose a visual hull algorithm, which guarantees a correct construction even in the presence of partial occlusion, while "correct" here means that the real shape is located inside the visual hull. The algorithm is based on a new idea of the "extended silhouette", which requires the silhouette from background subtraction and the "occlusion mask" of the same view. In order to prepare the occlusion mask, we also propose a novel concept of "effective boundary" of moving foreground objects in a video obtained from a static camera. The accumulation of the effective boundary through time automatically gives robust occluder boundaries. We theoretically prove that our algorithm deterministically computes the tightest, correct visual hull in the presence of occlusion. Both synthetic and real examples are given as a demonstration of the correctness of the algorithm. Finally we analyze that this new algorithm is still within the time complexity of the traditional method.

#!We classify 3D aerial LiDAR scattered height data into buildings, trees, roads, and grass using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. To do so we use five features: height, height variation, normal variation, LiDAR return intensity, and image intensity. We also use only LiDAR-derived features to organize the data into three classes (the road and grass classes are merged). We have implemented and experimented with several variations of the SVM algorithm with soft-margin classification to allow for the noise in the data. We have applied our results to classify aerial LiDAR data collected over approximately 8 square miles. We visualize the classification results along with the associated confidence using a variation of the SVM algorithm producing probabilistic classifications. We observe that the results are stable and robust. We compare the results against the ground truth and obtain higher than 90% accuracy and convincing visual results.

#!A low-complexity three-dimensional image compression algorithm based on wavelet transforms and set-partitioning strategy is presented. The Subband Block Hierarchial Partitioning (SBHP) algorithm is modified and extended to three dimensions, and applied to every code block independently. The resultant algorithm, 3D-SBHP, efficiently encodes 3D image data by the exploitation of the dependencies in all dimensions, while enabling progressive SNR and resolution decompression and Region-of-Interest (ROI) access from the same bit stream. The code-block selection method by which random access decoding can be achieved is outlined.The resolution scalable and random access performances are empirically investigated. The results show 3D-SBHP is a good candidate to compress 3D image data sets for multimedia applications.

#!In this paper, we present a computationally efficient technique for solving the difficult problem of estimating the global shape of a ceramic pot from measurements of its fragments. Each unknown pot is modeled as a surface of revolution, i.e., a 3D line-- the central axis of the pot -- and a 2D profile curve with respect to that axis. For each fragment, a probabilistic distribution is estimated which models both the geometric shape of the fragment and the variability of the estimated fragment shape. Estimation of the global pot shape is then a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) problem where we seek the values of the Euclidean transformation parameters that maximize the joint probability of the matched fragments' axis/profile-curvemodels (which includes the additional constraint that the matched fragments must share a common central axis). This is a new type of curve-analysis problem and our solution is a new and effective approach applicable for generic constrained 2D curve alignment and for modeling of 3D axially-symmetric surfaces and for comparing geometric models which may correspond over a subset of the complete model.

This method provides an "optimal" selection of 2D views to represent a 3D-model, and a probabilistic Bayesian method for 3D-model retrieval from realistic photos and sketches using these views. The characteristic view selection algorithm is based on an adaptive clustering algorithm and uses statistical model distribution scores to select the optimal number of views. We also introduce a Bayesian approach to score the probability of correspondence between the queries and the 3D-models. We present our results on the Princeton 3D Shape Benchmark database (1814 3D-models) and 50 photos (real photographs, sketches, synthesised images). A practical on-line 3D-model retrieval system based on our approach is available on the web to asset our results [1].

#!In this paper, we address the problem of finding depth from defocus in a fundamentally new way. Most previous methods have used an approximate model in which blurring is shift invariant and pixel area is negligible. Our model avoids these assumptions. We consider the area in the scene whose radiance is recorded by a pixel on the sensor, and relate the size and shape of that area to the scene's position with respect to the plane of focus. This is the notion of reverse projection, which allows us to illustrate that, when out of focus, neighboring pixels will record light from overlapping regions in the scene. This overlap results in a measurable change in the correlation between the pixels' intensity values. We demonstrate that this relationship can be characterized in such a way as to recover depth from defocused images. Experimental results show the ability of this relationship to accurately predict depth from correlation measurements.

#!Utilization of an acoustic camera for range measurements is a significant advantage for 3-D shape recovery of underwater targets by opti-acoustic stereo imaging, where the associated epipolar geometry of visual and acoustic image correspondences is described in terms of conic sections and trigonometric functions. In this paper, we propose and analyze a number of methods based on direct and indirect approaches that provide insight on the merits of the new imaging and 3-D object reconstruction paradigm. We have devised certain indirect methods, built on a regularization formulation, to first compute from noisy correspondences maximum likelihood estimates that satisfy the epipolar geometry. The 3-D target points can then be determined from a number of closed-form solutions applied to these ML estimates. An alternative direct approach is also presented for 3-D reocnstruction directly from noisy correspondences. Computer simulations verify consistency between the analytical and experimental reconstruction SNRs -- the criterion applied in performance assessment of these various solutions.

The registration of all input range images are determined by constructing the view tree of the input range images. The registration result of the proposed method is used as the initial value of a fine registration methods for object shape modeling.

This paper also introduces some novel approaches for moving object segmentation and sparse and dense reconstruction problems. According to the simulations for both synthetic and real data, the system achieves a promising performance for typical TV content, indicating that it is a significant step towards the 3D reconstruction of scenes from broadcast video.

Experimental speedups prove that our approach is efficient and perfectly adapted to the GPU, leading to nearly video frame rate reconstruction.

#!3D shape features are inherently scale-dependent. For instance, on a 3D model of a human body, the top of the head and a fingertip can both be detected as corner points, however, at entirely different scales. In this paper, we present a method for extracting and integrating 3D shape features in the discrete scale-space of a triangular mesh model. We first parameterize the surface of the mesh model on a 2D plane and then construct a dense surface normal map. In general, the parametrization is not isometric. To account for this, we compute the relative stretch of the original edge lengths. Next, we compute a dense distortion map which is used to approximate the geodesic distances on the normal map. Then, we construct a discrete scale-space of the original 3D shape by successively convolving the normal map with distortion-adapted Gaussian kernels of increasing standard deviation. We derive corner and edge detectors to extract 3D features at each scale in the discrete scale-space. Furthermore, we show how to combine the detector responses from different scales to form a unified representation of the 3D features.

This development fits in our long-standing tradition of combining expertise in video processing with our strength in display development to create the most exciting and best viewing experience. Philips developed several high-quality 3D displays, ranging in resolution, viewing angle, depth experience, and sizes from 4" to 40" and up. Backwards compatibility with 2D content is enabled via signal-processing or opto-electronic 3D & 2D dual mode displays. Content creation and conversion methods are provided, which are a key factor for the success of 3D displays. Fully automatic conversion from monoscopic 2D content into 3D enables the re-use of all existing 2D video material. Further methods enable 3D animation/design, 2D to 3D conversion in post-production and live capture of new 3D content. Our efforts in MPEG standardization towards the "2D-plus-depth" format for 3D video enables a flexible interface between the variety in 3D content creation methods and the range in 3D displays. Furthermore, the 3D format is compatible with existing 2D content, standards and infrastructure. Currently, Philips offers several commercial 3D products for professional use such as digital signage, and progress is being made towards consumer products such as 3DTV.

Next the 3D gaze vector is calculated by estimating the eyeball center and the cornea center of both eyes. For the intended application of visual perception research, we also propose a new screen registration scheme to accurately locate a planar screen in world coordinates within 2 mm error. We combine the 3D screen location with the 3D gaze vectors from both eyes to establish a point of focus on the screen. The experimental results indicate that an average error of the gaze direction of about 4.6± can be achieved and an average error of about 4 mm for the focus point location at a viewing distance of 50 cm.

#!Many applications in computer graphics need high level shape descriptions, in order to benefit from a global understanding of shapes. Topological approaches enable pertinent surface decompositions, providing structural descriptions of 3D polygonal meshes; but in practice, their use raises several difficulties. In this paper, we present a novel method for the construction of invariant high level Reeb graphs, topological entities that give a good overview of the shape structure. With this aim, we propose an accurate and straightforward feature point extraction algorithm for the computation of an invariant and meaningful quotient function. Moreover, we propose a new graph construction algorithm, based on an analysis of the connectivity evolutions of discrete level lines. This algorithm brings a practical solution for the suppression of non-significant critical points over piecewise continuous functions, providing meaningful Reeb graphs. Presented method gives accurate results, with satisfactory execution times and without input parameter. The geometrical invariance of resulting graphs and their robustness to variation in model pose and mesh sampling make them good candidates for several applications, like shape deformation (experimented in this paper), recognition, compression, indexing, etc.

This problem arises frequently in 3D photography applications that use images to acquire photometric properties of a scanned object. Our approach uses the ratio of the images and the geometry information to compute the relative incident irradiance of one image with respect to the other. After the irradiance maps are recovered, we build a spatially varying albedo map, which can then be used to render the object under different illumination conditions. We present two algorithms, one for point-light source illumination, and another one based on spherical harmonics for more general illumination conditions.

#!We present a 3D outdoor scene scanner for the acquisition of kilometers-deep scenes in night conditions. Its imaging system is based on a compact and low-cost pulsed laser illuminator and a light-intensifier equipped CCD camera. By precisely synchronizing both the illuminator and the camera shutter, it is possible to acquire "slices" of the scene at specific known distances. We show that even with large laser pulses and without megahertz-capable electronics, the third dimension can be recovered for the whole range of the scene by processing only two images acquired in specific conditions. As the pixel intensities of the images produced by active imaging systems vary with the square of the range, and due to the limited dynamics of image sensors, scanning long-range scenes with shorter "slices" allows the camera gain to be adjusted with respect to the range and the accuracy to be enhanced. The imaging system as well as the different image processing steps are detailed in this paper and an example of typical results is given.

#!We propose a new algorithm using deformable mesh model for complex 3D motion estimation of multiple objects from multi-viewpoint video. In this paper, we define "complex motion" as motion which includes global change of the object shape topology. In complex motion, a part of the object may touch the other parts. To manage this effect, we introduce (1) "repulsive force" into deformable mesh model for simple motion estimation which integrates texture and silhouette information into unified computation scheme, and (2) efficient collision detection algorithm for deformable mesh model. Our deformable mesh model with repulsive force keeps hidden, collided surfaces to be touched each other, and gives dense, non-rigid complex 3D motion of the object. Some experimental results show that our deformation model can estimate motions of multiple objects and the object's motion with time-varying global topology, and gives topologically-consistent mesh models which can be compressed efficiently by conventional inter-frame 3D data compression algorithms and be used for 3D motion analysis.

For infinitesimal camera motion (multiple flows rather than multiple images), we give a closed-form expression for the result of minimizing the true least-squares error over all variables but the camera's motion direction. Our result includes the rigidity constraint that the scene stays fixed over time. For finite motion, we present a noniterative algorithm that approximates the exact multi-image coplanarity error to better than a percent. Also, we define a new error contribution that incorporates the rigidity constraint and is analogous to the rigidity component of the error for infinitesimal motion. By adding this to the coplanarity error, we obtain a noniterative algorithm that approximates the complete finite motion least-squares error--including rigidity--as a function just of the translation direction.

#!The extrinsic camera parameters from video stream images can be accurately estimated by tracking features through the image sequence and using these features to compute parameter estimates. The poses for long video sequences have been estimated in this manner. However, the poses of large sets of still images cannot be estimated using the same strategy because wide-baseline correspondences are not as robust as narrow-baseline feature tracks. Moreover, video pose estimation requires a linear or hierarchically-linear ordering on the images to be calibrated, reducing the image matches to the neighboring video frames. We propose a novel generalization to the linear ordering requirement of video pose estimation by computing the Minimum Spanning Tree of the camera adjacency graph and using the tree hierarchy to determine the calibration order for a set of input images. We validate the pose accuracy using an error metric that is functionally independent of the estimation process. Because we do not rely on feature tracking for generating feature correspondences, our method can use internally calibrated wide- or narrow-baseline images as input, and can estimate the camera poses from multiple video streams without special pre-processing to concatenate the streams.

#!We propose a multiview tracking method for rigid objects. Assuming that a part of the object is visible in at least two cameras, a partial 3D model is reconstructed in terms of a collection of small 3D planar patches of arbitrary topology. The 3D representation, recovered fully automatically, allows to formulate tracking as gradient minimization in pose (translation, rotation) space. As the object moves, the 3D model is incrementally updated. A virtuous circle emerges: tracking enables composition of the partial 3D model; the 3D model facilitates and robustifies the multi-view tracking. We demonstrate experimentally that the interleaved track-and-reconstruct approach successfully tracks a 360 degrees turn-around and a wide range of motions. Monocular tracking is also possible after the model is constructed. Using more cameras, however, significantly increases stability in critical poses and moves. We demonstrate how to exploit the 3D model to increases stability in the presence of uneven and/or changing illumination.

#!The use of surface harmonics for rigid and nonrigid shape description is well known. In this paper we define a set of complete hemispherical harmonic basis functions on a hemisphere domain and propose a novel parametric shape description method to efficiently and flexibly represent the surfaces of anatomical structures in medical images. As the first application of hemispherical harmonic theory in shape description, our technique differs from the previous surface harmonics shape descriptors, all of which don't work efficiently on the hemisphere-like objects that often exist in medical anatomical structures (e.g., ventricles, atriums, etc.). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through theoretic and experimental exploration of a set of medical image applications. Furthermore, an evaluation criterion for surface modeling efficiency is described and the comparison results demonstrated that our method outperformed the previous approaches using spherical harmonic models.

Because the sensors do not share the same center of projection, nearby objects may not be properly aligned, creating a ghosting or echoing effect in the generated panorama, unless correct depth information is taken into account. Taking a cue from the similar problem of dense stereo, we approximate our scene with a Markov random field and use belief propagation to estimate the maximum a posteriori panoramic image for that scene.

#!A new model for the scattering of light from layered dielectrics with rough surface boundaries is introduced. The model contains a surface scattering component together with a subsurface scattering component. The former component corresponds to the roughness on the upper surface boundary and is modeled using the modified Beckmann model. The latter component accounts for both refraction due to Fresnel transmission through the layer and rough scattering at the lower layer boundary. By allowing independent roughness parameters for each surface boundary we can achieve excellent fits of the model to the measured BRDF data. Using a well known method of testing reflectance models, we experiment with BRDF data from skin surface samples (human volunteers) and show that the new model outperforms alternative variants of the Beckmann model and the Lafortune et al. reflectance model. As an application in computer graphics, we also show that realistic images of 3D surfaces can be generated using the new model, by setting the values of its physical parameters.

#!Multi-view stereo algorithms typically rely on same-exposure images as inputs due to the brightness constancy assumption. While state-of-the-art depth results are excellent, they do not produce high-dynamic range textures required for high-quality view reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a technique that adapts multi-view stereo for different exposure inputs to simultaneously recover reliable dense depth and high dynamic range textures. In our technique, we use an exposure-invariant similarity statistic to establish correspondences, through which we robustly extract the camera radiometric response function and the image exposures. This enables us to then convert all images to radiance space and selectively use the radiance data for dense depth and high dynamic range texture recovery. We show results for synthetic and real scenes.

#!A method for recovery of a 3D model of a planet-sized cloud-like structure that is in motion and deforming but approximately governed by magnetic field properties is described. The method allows recovery of the model from a single intensity image in which the structure's silhouette can be observed. The method exploits envelope theory and a magnetic field model. Given one intensity image and the segmented silhouette in the image, the method proceeds without human intervention to produce the 3D model. In addition to allowing 3D model synthesis, the method's capability to yield a very compact description offers further utility. Application of the method to real-world data is also demonstrated.

#!The paper proposes a novel approach for planar self-calibration of radially symmetric cameras. We model these camera images using notions of distortion center and concentric distortion circles around it. The rays corresponding to pixels lying on a single distortion circle form a right circular cone. Each of these cones is associated with two unknowns; optical center and focal length (opening angle). In the central case, we consider all distortion circles to have the same optical center, whereas in the non-central case they have different optical centers lying on the same optical axis. Based on this model we provide a factorization based self-calibration algorithm for planar scenes from dense image matches. Our formulation provides a rich set of constraints to validate the correctness of the distortion center. We also propose possible extensions of this algorithm in terms of non-planar scenes, non-unit aspect ratio and multi-view constraints. Experimental results are shown.

#!A common approach to model-based tracking is to use a model of the object to predict what will be observed, and then to compare that with real observations. For methods that make use of the object's photometric properties (appearance) in their measurements, illumination inconsistencies between the modeled and actual scene can cause tracking problems. In this paper we address one case: model-based tracking of Lambertian objects under directional light sources. We present an iterative optimization method that uses a Kalman filter to simultaneously refine estimates of the object motion, the illumination, and the model texture. We model the illumination variance between the real and predicted observation using the intensity ratios of corresponding surface points, which we then use to make model-based image predictions consistent with the real lighting. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method we present experimental results using both synthetic (controlled) and real image sequences.

#!We consider the problem of recovering 3D surface displacements using both shading and multi-view stereo cues. In contrast to traditional disparity or depth map representations, the object centered displacement map representation enables the recovery of complete 3D objects while also ensuring the reconstruction is not biased towards a particular image. Although displacement mapping requires a base surface, this base mesh is easily obtained using traditional computer vision techniques (e.g., shape-from-silhouette or structure-from-motion). Our method exploits shading variation due to object rotation relative to the light source, allowing the recovery of displacements in both textured and textureless regions in a common framework. In particular, shading cues are integrated into a multi-view stereo photo-consistency function through the surface normals that are implied by the displacement map. The analytic gradient of this photo-consistency function is used to drive a multiresolution conjugate gradient optimization. We demonstrate the geometric quality of the reconstructed displacements on several example objects including a human face.

#!This paper proposes a new technique for modeling and matching three-dimensional rigid objects by encoding the fluctuation of the surface and the variation of its normal around an oriented point on the surface as the surface expands. The surface of the object is encoded into two two-dimensional curves as the surface signature on each point, and then the collection of the signatures are used to model and match the object. The signatures implicitly encode the curvature and symmetry of the surface around an oriented point. This modeling technique is robust to scale, orientation, noise, patch resolution, occlusion, and cluttering.

We apply the obtained segmentation to improve subsequent 3D reconstruction results. Essentially, our framework combines a graph cut based optimization algorithm with an intuitive user interface. At first a meanshift segmentation algorithm partitions each image of the sequence into a certain number of regions. Additionally we provide an intelligent graphical user interface for easy specification of foreground as well as background regions across all images of the sequence. Within the graph cut optimization algorithm we define new energy terms to increase the robustness and to keep the segmentation of the foreground object coherent across all images of the sequence. Finally, a refined graph cut segmentation and several adjustment operations allow an accurate and effective foreground extraction. The obtained results are demonstrated on several real world data sets.

#!Depth Images are viable representations that can be computed from the real world using cameras and/or other scanning devices. The depth map provides 2\frac{1}{2}D structure of the scene. A set of Depth Images can provide hole-free rendering of the scene. Multiple views need to blended to provide smooth hole-free rendering, however. Such a representation of the scene is bulky and needs good algorithms for real-time rendering and efficient representation. In this paper, we present a discussion on the Depth Image representation and provide a GPU-based algorithm that can render large models represented using DIs in real time. We then present a proxy-based compression scheme for Depth Images and provide results for the same. Results are shown on synthetic scenes under different conditions and on some scenes generated from images. Lastly, we initiate discussion on varying quality levels in IBR and show a way to create representations using DIs with different trade-offs between model size and rendering quality. This enables the use of this representation for a variety of rendering situations.

#!Applications such as robot navigation and augmented reality require high-accuracy dense disparity maps in real-time and online. Due to time constraint, most real-time stereo applications rely on local winner-take-all optimization in the disparity computation process. These local approaches are generally outperformed by offline global optimization based algorithms. However, recent research shows that, through carefully selecting and aggregating the matching costs of neighboring pixels, the disparity maps produced by a local approach can be more accurate than those generated by many global optimization techniques. We are therefore motivated to investigate whether these cost aggregation approaches can be adopted in real-time stereo applications and, if so, how well they perform under the real-time constraint. The evaluation is conducted on a real-time stereo platform, which utilizes the processing power of programmable graphics hardware. Several recent cost aggregation approaches are also implemented and optimized for graphics hardware so that real-time speed can be achieved. The performances of these aggregation approaches in terms of both processing speed and result quality are reported.

#!Building footprints have been shown to be extremely useful in urban planning, infrastructure development, and roof modeling. Current methods for creating these footprints are often highly manual and rely largely on architectural blueprints or skilled modelers. In this work we will use aerial LIDAR data to generate building footprints automatically. Existing automatic methods have been mostly unsuccessful due to large amounts of noise around building edges. We present a novel Bayesian technique for automatically constructing building footprints from a pre-classified LIDAR point cloud. Our algorithm first computes a boundederror approximate building footprint using an application of the shortest path algorithm. We then determine the most probable building footprint by maximizing the posterior probability using linear optimization and simulated annealing techniques. We have applied our algorithm to more than 300 buildings in our data set and observe that we obtain accurate building footprints compared to the ground truth. Our algorithm is automatic and can be applied to other man-made shapes such as roads and telecommunication lines with minor modifications.

We present a system for processing multiple color images into an integrated texture that makes use of the laser scanner return intensity and the captured geometry, together with color balancing and mapping of illumination-corrected images onto the target geometry after filtering into two spatial frequency bands.

#!As the next generation of media, 3D video is attracting increased attention. 3D video is a sequence of three dimensional mesh models, captured and generated for a real dynamic object. In this paper, we present a simple framework of motion editing in 3D video database to re-use 3D video data. Our system is composed of two modules. In the first module, a motion database is automatically set up from original 3D video sequences off-line by analyzing the feature vectors of each frame. It is observed that our original 3D video sequences have a two-level temporal structure. A fine-to-coarse method is proposed to extract such a structure. 3D video is segmented into the fine-level structure by a three reference frame strategy and then is clustered into the coarse-level structure. In the second module, users can synthesize the motions to edit a new 3D video sequence online. A cost function is optimized to transit between two motions with the users' requirements. All the algorithms in the system are based on the analysis in feature vector space and the edited 3D video sequence is played using OpenGL.

The proposed pipeline is suitable for long image sequences and uses a plane-sweep depth estimation procedure optionally employing robust image similarity functions to generate a set of depth images. The subsequent volumetric fusion step combines these depth maps into an impicit surface representation of the final model, which can be directly displayed using GPU-based raycasting methods. Depending on the number of input views and the desired resolution of the final model the computing times range from several seconds to a few minutes. The quality of the obtained models is illustrated with real-world datasets.

#!Obtaining a digital model of a real-world 3D scene is a challenging task pursued by computer vision and computer graphics. Given an initial approximate 3D model, a popular refinement process is to perform a bundle adjustment of the estimated camera position, camera orientation, and scene points. Unfortunately, simultaneously solving for both camera position and camera orientation is an ill-conditioned problem. To address this issue, we propose an improved, camera-orientation independent cost function that can be used instead of the standard bundle adjustment cost function. This yields a new bundle adjustment formulation which exhibits noticeably better numerical behavior, but at the expense of an increased computational cost. We alleviate the additional cost by automatically partitioning the dataset into smaller subsets. Minimizing our cost function for these subsets still achieves significant error reduction over standard bundle adjustment. We empirically demonstrate our formulation using several different size models and image sequences.

#!In this paper we present a prototype system for image based localization in urban environments. Given a database of views of city street scenes tagged by GPS locations, the system computes the GPS location of a novel query view. We first use a wide-baseline matching technique based on SIFT features to select the closest views in the database. Often due to a large change of viewpoint and presence of repetitive structures, a large percentage of matches (> 50%) are not correct correspondences. The subsequent motion estimation between the query view and the reference view, is then handled by a novel and efficient robust estimation technique capable of dealing with large percentage of outliers. This stage is also accompanied by a model selection step among the fundamental matrix and the homography. Once the motion between the closest reference views is estimated, the location of the query view is then obtained by triangulation of translation directions. Approximate solutions for cases when triangulation cannot be obtained reliably are also described. The presented system is tested on the dataset used in ICCV 2005 Computer Vision Contest and is shown to have higher accuracy than previous reported results.

#!Extended Kalman filters (EKF) have been proposed to estimate ego-motion and to recursively update scene structure in the form of 3-D positions of selected prominent features from motion and stereo sequences. Previous methods typically accommodate no more than a few dozen features for real-time processing. To maintain motion estimation accuracy, this calls for high contrast images to compute image feature locations with precision. Within manmade environments, various prominent corner points exist that can be extracted and tracked with required accuracy. However, prominent features are more difficult to localize precisely in natural scenes. Statistically, more feature points become necessary to maintain the same level of motion estimation accuracy and robustness. However, this imposes a computational burden beyond the capability of EKF-based techniques for real-time processing. A sequential dual EKF estimator utilizing stereo data is proposed for improved computation efficiency. Two important issues, unbiased estimation and stochastic stability are addressed. Furthermore, the dynamic feature set is handled in a more effective, efficient and robust way. Experimental results to demonstrate the merits of the new theoretical and algorithmic developments are presented.

#!To support real-time computation with large, possibly evolving point clouds and range data, we fit a trimmed uniform tensor-product spline function from one direction. The graph of this spline serves as a surrogate for the cloud, closely following the data safely in that, according to user choice, the data are always "below' or "above' when viewed in the fitting direction. That is, the point cloud is guaranteed to be completely covered from that direction and can be sandwiched between two matching spline surfaces if required. This yields both a data reduction since only the spline control points need to be further processed and defines a continuous surface in lieu of the isolated measurement points. For example, using a 20× 20 spline, clouds of 300K points are safely approximated in less than 1/2 second.

#!Using Epipolar Image Analysis in the context of the correspondence finding problem in depth reconstruction has several advantages.

The proposed framework in conjunction with graph cut optimization is able to reconstruct also highly specular surfaces. The use of prior knowledge and multiple images opens new ways to reconstruct surfaces and scenes impossible or error prone with previous methods. Another advantage is improved occlusion handling. Pixels that are partly occluded contribute to the reconstruction results. The proposed shifting of some of the computation to graphics hardware (GPU) results in a significant speed improvement compared to pure CPU-based implementations.

#!This paper presents an approach to recover body motions from multiple views using a 3D skeletal model. It takes, as input, foreground silhouette sequences from multiple viewpoints, and computes, for each frame, the skeleton pose which best fit the body pose. Skeletal models encode mostly motion information and allows therefore to separate motion estimation from shape estimation for which solutions exist; And focusing on motion parameters significantly reduces the dependancy on specific body shapes, yielding thus more flexible solutions for body motion capture. However, a problem generally faced with skeletal models is to find adequate measurements with which to fit the model. In this paper, we propose to use the medial axis of the body shape to this purpose. Such medial axis can be estimated from the visual hull, a shape approximation which is easily obtained from the silhouette information. Experiments show that this approach is robust to several perturbations in the model or in the input data, and also allows fast body motions or, equivalently, important motions between consecutive frames.

#!Working with IBR/BTF data requires a complete calibration. Modern setups speed up recordings by using multiple lamps and cameras. Therefore, the calibration task gets more time consuming and challenging, especially for an accurate calibration of multiple light sources. Most works are dedicated to the calibration of cameras, whereas the light field calibration problem remains as a rule overlooked. Our experiments have shown that the spatial variance of light strength can be vigorous, inducing serious damage to the IBR/BTF data. We propose a novel method based on Helmholtz reciprocity, which derives light field information directly from the target IBR/BTF data rather than from specially dedicated calibration objects. Instead of repeating the recording of a huge number of images, only one additional image is needed.

#!This paper presents a novel object recognition approach based on range images. Due to its insensitivity to illumination, range data is well suited for reliable silhouette extraction. Silhouette or contour descriptions are good sources of information for object recognition. We propose a complete object recognition system, based on a 3D laser scanner, reliable contour extraction with floor interpretation, feature extraction using a new, fast Eigen-CSS method, and a supervised learning algorithm. The recognition system was successfully tested on range images acquired with a mobile robot, and the results are compared to standard techniques, i.e., Geometric features, Hu and Zernike moments, the Border Signature method and the Angular Radial Transformation. An evaluation using the receiver operating characteristic analysis completes this paper. The Eigen-CSS method has proved to be comparable in detection performance to the top competitors, yet faster than the best one by an order of magnitude in feature extraction time.

#!Medial surfaces are popular representations of 3D objects in vision, graphics and geometric modeling. They capture relevant symmetries and part hierarchies and also allow for detailed differential geometric information to be recovered. However, exact algorithms for their computation from meshes must solve high-order polynomial equations, while approximation algorithms rarely guarantee soundness and completeness. In this article we develop a technique for computing the medial surface of an object with a polyhedral boundary, which is based on an analysis of the average outward flux of the gradient of its Euclidean distance function. This analysis leads to a coarse-to-fine algorithm implemented on a cubic lattice that reveals at each iteration the salient manifolds of the medial surface. We provide comparative results against a state-of-the-art method in the literature.

#!In this paper, a unified, segmentation-based approach is proposed to deal with both stereo reconstruction and moving objects detection problems using multiple stereo mosaics. Each set of parallel-perspective (pushbroom) stereo mosaics is generated from a video sequence captured by a single video camera. First a color-segmentation approach is used to extract the so-called natural matching primitives from a reference view of a pair of stereo mosaics to facilitate both 3D reconstruction of textureless urban scenes and man-made moving targets (e.g. vehicles). Multiple pairs of stereo mosaics are used to improve the accuracy and robustness in 3D recovery and occlusion handling. Moving targets are detected by inspecting their 3D anomalies, either violating the epipolar geometry of the pushbroom stereo or exhibiting abnormal 3D structure. Experimental results on both simulated and real video sequences are provided to show the effectiveness of our approach.

#!This paper introduces a novel method for surface reconstruction using the depth discontinuity information captured by a multi-flash camera while the object moves along a known trajectory. Experimental results based on turntable sequences are presented. By observing the visual motion of depth discontinuities, surface points are accurately reconstructed - including many located deep inside concavities. The method extends well-established differential and global shape-from-silhouette surface reconstruction techniques by incorporating the significant additional information encoded in the depth discontinuities. The reconstruction method uses an implicit form of the epipolar parameterization and directly estimates point locations and corresponding surface normals on the surface of the object using a local temporal neighborhood of the depth discontinuities. Outliers, which correspond to the ill-conditioned cases of the reconstruction equations, are easily detected and removed by back-projection. Gaps resulting from curvaturedependent sampling and shallow concavities are filled by fitting an implicit surface to the oriented point cloud's point locations and normal vectors.

#!We present a novel method for detecting and quantifying 3D structure in stacks of microscopic images captured at incremental focal lengths. We express the image data as stochastically generated by an underlying model for biological specimen and the effects of the imaging system. The method simultaneously fits a model for proposed structure and the imaging system's parameters, which include a model of the point spread function. We demonstrate our approach by detecting spores in image stacks of Alternaria, a microscopic genus of fungus. The spores are modeled as opaque ellipsoids and fit to the data using statistical inference. Since the number of spores in the data is not known, model selection is incorporated into the fitting process. Thus, we develop a reversible jump Markov chainMonte Carlo sampler to explore the parameter space. Our results show that simultaneous statistical inference of specimen and imaging models is useful for quantifying biological structures in 3D microscopic images. In addition, we show that inferring a model of the imaging system improves the overall fit of the specimen model to the data.

#!This paper introduces a new compression scheme, so-called Multi-Chart Geometry Video (MCGV), for 3D dynamic meshes with constant connectivity and time-varying geometry. The core of the proposed method is a piecewise affine predictor coupled with a Multi-Chart Geometry IMage (MCGIM) representation of the residual errors. The mesh is first partitioned into vertex clusters whose motion can be accurately described by a unique 3D affine transform. The prediction errors are represented as MCGIMs which are compressed by using standardized image encoders such as JPEG and MPEG-4. The performances of our encoder are objectively evaluated on a data set of six animation sequences with various sizes, geometries and topologies, and exhibiting both rigid and elastic motions. The experimental evaluation shows that the proposed MCGV achieves up to 60% lower compression distortions than the geometry video approach, while outperforming (with 30% to 94% lower distortions) the RT, MPEG-4/AFX-IC, D3DMC, PCA and Dynapack techniques.

#!Detection and analysis of ocean surface phenomena have so far relied on manual analysis of long sequences of satellite images or images produced from the mathematical models. In this paper a technique for the three-dimensional shape analysis and spato-temporall tracking of mesoscale eddies from MICOM dataset is presented. Mesoscale eddies play a strong role in carrying heat poleward. The shape analysis of eddies provides a volumetric estimation which can be further used to determine the heat trapped in eddies. Eddies are detected and the region of swirling currents around the detected center is segmented. Segmented eddies are stacked to generate 3D visualization. A 3D skeleton is obtained with the centroids of all the layers in the segmented eddy and represented parametrically. Coefficients of the parametric representation are used for motion tracking of eddies.

#!We propose artificial potential fields as a support theory for a feature linking algorithm. This algorithm operates on 3D triangle meshes derived from multiple range scans of an object, and the features of interest are curvature extrema on the object's surface. A problem that arises with detecting these features is that results from standard algorithms are often incomplete in that feature lines are broken and discontinuous. Our novel linking algorithm closes these broken feature lines to form a more complete feature description. The main contribution of this algorithm is the use of arti- ficial potential fields to govern the linking process. In this paper, we discuss the feature detection process itself and then define the linking procedure in the context of potential fields. We present results for both synthetic and scanned models.

#!Range sensing technology allows the photorealistic modeling of large-scale scenes, such as urban structures. The generated 3D representations, after automated registration, are useful for urban planning, historical preservation, or virtual reality applications. One major issue in 3D modeling of complex large-scale scenes is that the final result is a dense complicated mesh. Significant, in some cases manual, post-processing (mesh simplification, hole filling) is required to make this representation usable by graphics or CAD applications. This paper presents a 3D modeling approach that models large planar scene areas of the scene with planar primitives (extracted via a segmentation pre-process), and non-planar areas with mesh primitives. In that respect, the final model is significantly compressed. Also, lines of intersection between neighboring planes are modeled as such. These steps bring the model closer to graphics/CAD applications. We present results from experiments with complex range scans from urban structures and from the interior of a large-scale landmark urban building (Grand Central Terminal, NYC).

#!We propose a technique for 3D face registration and matching using a novel representation called "isoradius contours". An isoradius contour is the contour on the 3D facial surface that is a known fixed distance relative to some predefined reference point (the tip of the nose). A 3D face representation contains many isoradius contours with different radii and the first major benefit of the technique is that the shape of the contours is independent of the facial pose, due to the infinite rotational symmetry of a sphere. The second major benefit of the technique is that registration, alignment and matching can be implemented using a simple process of 1D correlation. Our results have shown that registration and alignment is of comparable accuracy to ICP (iterative closest points), but is fast, non iterative, and is robust to the presence of outliers.

#!A prerequisite to calibrated camera pose estimation is the construction of a camera neighborhood adjacency graph, a connected graph defining the pose neighbors of the camera set. Pose neighbors to a camera C are images containing sufficient overlap in image content with the image from C that they can be used to correctly estimate the pose of C using structure-from-motion techniques. In a video stream, the camera neighborhood adjacency graph is often a simple connected path; frame poses are only estimated relative to their immediate neighbors. We propose a novel method to build more complex camera adjacency graphs that are suitable for estimating the pose of large numbers of wide- and narrow-baseline images. We employ Content-Based Image Retrieval techniques to identify similar images likely to be graph neighbors. We also develop an optimization to improve graph accuracy that is based on an observation of common camera motions taken when photographing with the intent of structure-from-motion. Our results substantiate the use of our method for determining neighbors for pose estimation.

#!We describe a system which produces a dense accu- rate range image using 8 consecutive frames of camera data in conjunction with a special projector. A proto- type has been built and tested, and yields a typical range error of about 0.2mm at 2 meters range with a baseline just over one meter. The camera is directed at a scene, along with a stripe projector consisting of a thin light source (xenon tube and slit) on the axis of a turntable, and a binary mask conforming to a cylinder coaxial with this. The mask has alternate opaque and transparent stripes parallel to the axis. It forms a sequence in which each sub- sequence of given length n (8 here) is different. No lens is used in the projector, deliberately smooth- ing the resulting illumination in a shadowing process. In operation, the turntable rotates, and images are taken at uniform angular intervals for several consecu- tive frames. In the consecutive frames, a given pixel records samples of the brightness of a fixed surface point. The vector consisting of those samples, when normalized, is unique to the place in the sequence from which it came, thus enabling the computation, via a fast indexing process, of the 3D position of the surface point. The code is similar to a DeBruijn sequence, but modified to reduce range error. Several types of calibra- tion and error compensation were used to produce an accurate range image.

#!We present a registration framework based on feature points of anatomical 3D shapes represented in the point cloud domain. Anatomical information is utilized throughout the complete registration process. The surfaces, which in this paper are ear impression models, are considered to be similar in the way that they possess the same anatomical regions but with varying geometry. First, in a shape analysis step, features of important anatomical regions (such as canal, aperture, and concha) are extracted automatically. Next these features are used in ordinary differential equations that update rigid registration parameters between two sets of feature points. For refinement of the results, the GCP algorithm is applied. Through our experiments, we demonstrate our technique's success in surface registration through registration of key anatomical regions of human ear impressions. Furthermore, we show that the proposed method achieves higher accuracy and faster performance than the standard GCP registration algorithm.

#!We propose a mathematical approach for quantifying shape complexity of 3D surfaces based on perceptual principles of visual saliency. Our curvature variation measure (CVM), as a 3D feature, combines surface curvature and information theory by leveraging bandwidth-optimized kernel density estimators. Using a part decomposition algorithm for digitized 3D objects, represented as triangle meshes, we apply our shape measure to transform the low level mesh representation into a perceptually informative form. Further, we analyze the effects of noise, sensitivity to digitization, occlusions, and descriptiveness to demonstrate our shape measure on laser-scanned real world 3D objects.

#!This paper describes a probabilistic method of aligning and merging range images. We formulate these issues as problems of estimating the maximum likelihood. By examining the error distribution of a range finder, we model it as a normal distribution along the line of sight. To align range images, our method estimates the parameters based on the ExpectationMaximization (EM) approach. By assuming the error model, the algorithm is implemented as an extension of the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) method. For merging range images, our method computes the signed distances by finding the distances of maximum likelihood. Since our proposed method uses multiple correspondences for each vertex of the range images, errors after aligning and merging range images are less than those of earlier methods that use one-to-one correspondences. Finally, we tested and validated the efficiency of our method by simulation and on real range images .

#!We present a novel method for recovering the 3D-line structure of a scene from multiple widely separated views. Traditional optimization-based approaches to line-based structure from motion minimize the error between measured line segments and the projections of corresponding 3D lines. In such a case, 3D lines can be optimized using a minimum of 4 parameters. We show that this number of parameters can be further reduced by introducing additional constraints on the orientations of lines in a 3D scene. In our approach, 2D-lines are automatically detected in images with the assistance of an EM-based vanishing point estimation method which assumes the existence of edges along mutally orthogonal vanishing directions. Each detected line is automatically labeled with the orientation (e.g. vertical, horizontal) of the 3D line which generated the measurement, and it is this additional knowledge that we use to reduce the number of degrees of freedom of 3D lines during optimization. We present 3D reconstruction results for urban scenes based on manually established feature correspondences across images.

#!We describe an interactive system that models regions of an urban environment, such as a group of tall buildings. Traditional image-based modeling methods often cannot model such large areas due to error accumulation and limited camera field of view. Our approach widens the camera field of view by constructing a 360 degree panorama from ground-level images and uses a high resolution ortho-rectified aerial image to provide the building footprints. Users draw the building outlines in the aerial image and select a point as the approximate ground camera location. The method automatically extracts roof corners in the ground images and registers the panorama to the aerial image according to geometric constraints. The height of each building is calculated from an estimated camera pose. The resulting textured model of the buildings is constructed of planar surfaces.

#!Shape from silhouette methods are extensively used to model dynamic and non-rigid objects using binary foreground-background images. Since the problem of reconstructing shapes from silhouettes is ambiguous, a number of solutions exist and several approaches only consider the one with a maximal volume, called the visual hull. However, the visual hull is not always a good approximation of shapes, in particular when observing smooth surfaces with few cameras. In this paper, we consider instead a class of solutions to the silhouette reconstruction problem that we call visual shapes. Such a class includes the visual hull, but also better approximations of the observed shapes which can take into account local assumptions such as smoothness, among others. Our contributions with respect to existing works is first to identify silhouette consistent shapes different from the visual hull, and second to give a practical way to estimate such shapes in real time. Experiments on various sets of data including human body silhouettes are shown to illustrate the principle and the interests of visual shapes.

This paper describe how this revolutionary data set can be used to simulate anywhere around the Earth low altitude wind conditions for various atmospheric conditions. More specifically, we will describe the various processing steps necessary to convert this high-resolution terrain model provided by the SRTM database into a Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) volumetric mesh that is compatible with an open source CFD solver called OpenFOAM running in parallel on largeWest- Grid supercomputers.

#!Camera models are essential infrastructure in computer vision, computer graphics, and visualization. The most frequently used camera models are based on the single-viewpoint constraint. Removing this constraint brings the advantage of improved flexibility in camera design. However, prior camera models that eliminate the single-viewpoint constraint are inefficient. We describe an approximate model for coherent general cameras, which projects efficiently with user chosen accuracy. The rays of the general camera are partitioned into simple cameras that approximate the camera locally. The simple cameras are modeled with k-ray cameras, a novel class of non-pinhole cameras. The rays of a k-ray camera interpolate between k construction rays. We analyze several variants of k-ray cameras. The resulting compound camera model is efficient because the number of simple cameras is orders of magnitude lower than the original number of rays camera, and because each simple camera offers closed-form projection.

#!When an observer moves through a rigid 3D scene, points that are near to the observer move with a different image velocity than points that are far away. The difference between image velocity vectors is the direction of motion parallax. This direction vector points towards the observer's translation direction. Hence estimates of the direction of motion parallax are useful for estimating the observer's translation direction. Standard ways to compute the direction of motion parallax either rely on precomputed optical flow, or rely on motion compensation to remove the local image shift caused by observer rotation. Here we present a simple Fourier-based method for estimating the direction of motion parallax directly, that does not require optical flow and motion compensation. The method is real-time and performs accurately for image regions in which multiple motions are present.

In this paper we propose to extend the approach to colored 3D models, which start to become more and more popular. To this end we propose a content descriptor that combines together shape and color information and it is based on an extension of spin-images, where also texture information is taken into account. The proposed approach has been evaluated on a collection of 600 automatically colored 3D models, considering as relevant to a query only the models with the same shape and the same added texture. Results show that the approach gave good results in terms of retrieval effectiveness, also if compared to a pure shape-based approach. Issues related to computational cost have been addressed proposing two alternative improvements that have been evaluated and compared with the basic approach.

#!In this paper, we develop a new hybrid active vision/ geometric modeling approach dedicated to 3D human face recovery. Initially, a 3D coarse reconstruction is obtained via a structured-light assisted stereo sensor. Here, the stereo matching problem is resolved through two main stages: (a) sub-pixel stripe edge localization of projected patterns of light, and (b) correspondences establishing based on adaptive dynamic programming optimization technique. Next, the introduction of smooth interpolation models achieves the fine reconstruction. Here, cubic Spline curves are employed in order to improve the quality of the reconstructed models. Indeed, they allow us to produce dense and details preserving reconstructions by following the control points from the coarse reconstruction stage. Furthermore, we present some reconstruction results and discuss both qualitative and quantitative evaluations of the proposed reconstruction scheme.

The learned information is formulated by a pairwise Markov network. Each node of the network is a random variable corresponding to the position of a landmark. The edges of the network represent correlations between the positions of landmark pairs. Probabilistic inference is then performed over the Markov network to locate the landmarks. We evaluated the algorithm on 30 human models with different shapes. The results showed good accuracy for most of the landmarks.

#!Remote navigation in compressed image-based scene representations requires random access to arbitrary parts of the reference image data to recompose virtual views. The degree of inter-frame dependencies exploited during compression has an impact on the effort needed to access reference images and delimits the rate distortion (RD) trade-off that can be achieved. If, additionally, a given receiver hardware and a maximum available channel bitrate is taken into account, the traditional rate-distortion optimization is extended to an RDTC trade-off between rate (R), distortion (D), transmission data rate (T), and decoding complexity (C). In this work we introduce our RDTC optimized compression framework. In addition, an experimental testbed for streaming of these RDTC optimally compressed image-based scene representations is described and the impact of client side caching is investigated. Our results show a significant reduction in user perceived delay for RDTC optimized streams in such a remote browsing environment compared to RD optimized or independently encoded scene representations.

#!This paper introduces a feature based method for the fast generation of sparse 3D point clouds from multiple images with known pose. We extract sub-pixel edge elements (2D position plus associated orientation) and use a space sweeping scheme to compute the accurate 3D location of these edge features. Our approach relies mainly on the geometric properties of the extracted primitives and incorporates a robust uncertainty estimation to detect outliers. Epipolar constraints between views are used to narrow down the search space of potential candidates in the images. In order to improve the efficiency of spatial queries, for detecting edgels lying close to an epipolar line, we utilise a pairwise stereo rectification scheme. The detection and verification of tentative hypotheses is carried out in 3D-space, thus allowing to perform an event driven search mode. An uncertainty measure that models the location inaccuracies in the feature extraction process and errors introduced in the camera pose estimation stage allows to assign a likelihood value to each hypothesis. Optionally an image-based similarity measure can be used to verify the 3D hypotheses and to identify false positives. We perform experiments on a synthetic data set and on several real datasets. The results indicate that the proposed method yields accurate measurements on depth discontinuities and thus represents a complementary technique to standard dense matching approaches.

#!This paper addresses the problem of camera self-calibration, bundle adjustment and 3D reconstruction from line segments in two images of poorly-textured indoor scenes. First, we generate line segment correspondences, using an extended version of our previously proposed matching scheme. The first main contribution is a new method to identify polyhedral junctions resulting from the intersections of the line segments. At the same time, the images are segmented into planar polygons. This is done using an algorithm based on a Binary Space Partitioning (BSP) tree. The junctions are matched end points of the detected line segments and hence can be used to obtain the epipolar geometry. The essential matrix is considered for metric camera calibration. For better stability, the second main contribution consists in a bundle adjustment on the line segments and the camera parameters that reduces the number of unknowns by a maximum flow algorithm. Finally, a piecewise-planar 3D reconstruction is computed based on the segmentation of the BSP tree. The system's performance is tested on some challenging examples.

#!We present a systematic view planning method to assist construction of 3-D models of large outdoor sites using a mobile robot platform with mounted scanner. In the first stage, we begin with a 2-D site footprint and the planner generates a minimal set of sufficient covering views. These views which incorporate constraints on the scanner, including field of view, minimum and maximum scanning distance, and grazing angle, serve as the initial set of scans which yields an approximate 3-D model of the site. In the second stage, we update this model by using a voxel-based occupancy procedure to plan and acquire the next best view. The algorithm continues to update the model sequentially until an accurate and complete 3-D model is obtained. Results are shown for a segment of the Columbia University campus. The system can also be used as a planning tool for manual construction of 3-D site models.

#!Creating models of real objects is a complex task for which the use of traditional modeling techniques has proven to be difficult. To solve some of these problems, laser rangefinders are frequently used to sample an object´s surface from several viewpoints resulting in a set of range images that are registered and integrated into a final triangulated model. In practice, due to surface reflectance properties, occlusions and accessibility limitations, certain areas of the object´s surface are usually not sampled, leaving holes which create undesirable artifacts in the integrated model. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for the automatic hole-filling of triangulated models. The algorithm starts by locating hole boundary regions. A hole consists of a closed path of edges of boundary triangles that have at least an edge, which is not shared with any other triangle. The edge of the hole is then fitted with a b-spline where the average variation of the torsion of the b-spline approximation is calculated. Using a simple threshold of the average variation of the torsion along the edge, one can automatically classify real holes from man-made holes. Following this classification process, we then use an automated version of a radial basis function interpolator to fill the inside of the hole using neighboring edges. Excellent experimental results are presented.

We also introduce a novel strategy for distortion-sensitive synthesis of both geometry and rendered imagery at client side.

#!Object modeling under consideration of geometric constraints is an important task. In this paper we describe a novel approach to achieving this goal. It has the nice property that all geometric constraints can be absolutely satis- fied. To our knowledge it seems to be the first one with guaranteed constraint fulfillment. It is realized by integrating these constraints as hard conditions into the fitting process, in contrast to their use as soft optimization criteria in earlier work. We describe the principle behind our approach and give examples to show how it can be applied to practice. Experimental results will be reported on objects with numerous complex constraints. The technique proposed in this paper is expected to have a great impact in reverse engineering applications and manufactured object modeling where the majority of parts are designed with intended feature relationships.

#!3D transmission over unreliable networks needs to take into account the possibility of packet loss. In this work we describe a perceptually motivated strategy for joint transmission of texture and mesh over unreliable networks. The approach is described initially considering regular mesh structure, to show the utility of optimizing the texture-mesh tradeoff. In order to generalize our approach to arbitrary meshes we consider stripification of the mesh, combined with a strategy that does not need texture or vertex packets to be re-transmitted. Only the valence (connectivity) packets need to be re-transmitted; however, storage of valence information requires only 10% space compared to vertices and even less compared to photo-realistic texture. Thus, only less than 5% of the packets may need to be re-transmitted in the worst case to allow our algorithm to successfully reconstruct an acceptable object under severe packet loss. Results showing the implementation of the proposed approach are described.

#!Range sensing technology allows the photo-realistic modeling of large-scale scenes, such as urban structures. A major bottleneck in the process of 3D scene acquisition is the automated registration of a large number of geometrically complex 3D range scans in a common frame of reference. The generated 3D representations, after automated registration, are useful for urban planning, historical preservation, or virtual reality applications. Man-made urban scenes provide an abundance of linear features that can be used for the solution of the problem. Many scenes though require the utilization of non-linear primitives. This paper provides a solution of the registration problem based on the robust detection and matching of circular features from the range data sets. We present results from experiments with complex range scans from the interior of a large-scale landmark urban structure (Grand Central Terminal, NYC), where traditional methods would fail. This work is part of a larger range registration system that is based on extracted features of multiple geometric types.

#!In this paper we derive a novel set of projective invariants and we address the problem of homography estimation between two uncalibrated views from two unmodeled coplanar conics. Exploring in each view the eigenvectors of a matrix composed from the conics matrices and pole-polar relationships, we show that homography can be recovered purely geometrical from invariant points and simple intersections avoiding high-order polynomials and non linear equations. Our method has advantages compared with other approaches, is simple and computational efficient. The estimation process is basically linear and there are no ambiguities on the solution. Furthermore it requires neither that the physical models of the conics are known nor that the cameras are calibrated. Experimental results in both simulate data and real images show that our approach is very robust and can be efficiently used for a large number of applications

#!3D city modeling using computer vision is very challenging. A typical city contains objects which are a nightmare for some vision algorithms, while other algorithms have been designed to identify exactly these parts but, in their turn, suffer from other weaknesses which limit their application. For instance, moving cars with metallic surfaces can degrade the results of a 3D city reconstruction algorithm which is primarily based on the assumption of a static scene with diffuse reflection properties. On the other hand, a specialized object recognition algorithm could be able to detect cars, but also yields too many false positives without the availability of additional scene knowledge. In this paper, the design of a cognitive loop which intertwines both aforementioned algorithms is demonstrated for 3D city modeling, proving that the whole can be much more than the simple sum of its parts. A cognitive loop is the mutual transfer of higher knowledge between algorithms, which enables the combination of algorithms to overcome the weaknesses of any single algorithm. We demonstrate the promise of this approach on a real-world city modeling task using video data recorded by a survey vehicle. Our results show that the cognitive combination of algorithms delivers convincing city models which improve upon the degree of realism that is possible from a purely reconstruction-based approach.

The portable computer is connected to a backend server via WLAN. Minimisation of the bandwidth usage of the system ensures that 20 or more systems can operate on one standard WLAN access point. The main focus of this article is to minimise the computational load of the mobile system and the network load simultaneously.

#!A few 3D interactive modeling systems have been developed recently. Such systems must cope with a high flow of input measurements during the entire acquisition period. Therefore, the reconstruction and rendering algorithms used must all run online. However, compression algorithms are still run offline as postprocessing. In order to develop a fully interactive modeling framework, this paper presents an online compression algorithm where the system automatically adjusts the level of detail according to the user behavior. The proposed method can reduce peak memory consumption by more than 50% during the acquisition of a typical model and the final result is comparable to offline compression. Furthermore, the results obtained show that a local acquisition approach must be prioritized.

#!We present a probabilistic framework for correspondence and egomotion. First, we suggest computing probability distributions of correspondence. This has the advantage of being robust to points subject to the aperture effect and repetitive structure, while giving up no information at feature points. Additionally, correspondence probability distributions can be computed for every point in the scene. Next, we generate a probability distribution over the motions, from these correspondence probability distributions, through a probabilistic notion of the epipolar constraint. Finding the maximum in this distribution is shown to be a generalization of least-squared epipolar minimization. We will show that because our technique allows so much correspondence information to be extracted, more accurate egomotion estimation is possible.

#!A new real-time 3D sensor is presented that is capable of delivering 25 high-resolution depth maps per second with a representative measurement error of 0.2 mm. The sensor is well suited for real-world application as it imposes no major scene constraints, i.e. it copes well with colored objects, moving scenes and background illumination. The acquisition technique, which is a form of structured light with a single projection pattern, is introduced, where the focus is on two aspects: Firstly, a new type of projection pattern that employs local color edge patterns for encoding so that it is possible to decode them even under noisy real-world conditions. Secondly, an algorithm that exploits the pattern properties to recognize the projected color edge patterns reliably. It then describes a 3D sensor based on this technique and presents experimental results obtained with it. It furthermore discusses an exemplary commercial application of the 3D sensor to the task of wheel alignment.

#!We present an alternate approach to the problem of structure from motion (SfM) with noisy point measurements. With no information available about the joint density of three-dimensional points, the assumption of independence is the only reasonable one. With this assumption alone, the process of the factorization of the observed projections of inaccurately measured 3 dimensional points into motion and shape matrices is a blind source separation (demixing) problem in the presence of noise. This approach is very general, allowing the extension of all previous work on source separation to be applied to SfM in an information theory context. A significant reduction in the error of the estimation of the motion and shape matrices over other methods is possible.

#!Self-calibration is one of the most active issues concerning vision-based 3D measurements. However, in the case of the light sectioning method, there has been little research conducted on self-calibration techniques. In this paper, we study the problem of self-calibration for an active vision system which uses line lasers and a single camera. The problem can be defined as the estimation of multiple laser planes from the curves of laser reflections observed from a sequence of images captured by a single camera. The constraints of the problem can be obtained from observed intersection points between the curves. In this condition, the problem is formulated as simultaneous polynomial equations, in which the number of equations is larger than the number of variables. Approximated solutions of the equations can be computed by using Gr¨obner bases. By refining them using nonlinear optimization, the final result can be obtained. We developed an actual 3D measurement system using the proposed method, which consists of only a laser projector with two line lasers and a single camera. Users are just required to move the projector freely so that the projected lines sweep across the surface of the scene to get the 3D shape.

#!This paper addresses the challenging problem of statistics on images by describing average and variability. We describe computational anatomy tools for building 3-D and spatio-temporal 4-D atlases of volumetric image data. The method is based on the previously published concept of unbiased atlas building, calculating the nonlinear average image of a population of images by simultaneous nonlinear deformable registration. Unlike linear averaging, the resulting center average image is sharp and encodes the average structure and geometry of the whole population. Variability is encoded in the set of deformation maps. As a new extension, longitudinal change is assessed by quantifying local deformation between atlases taken at consecutive time points. Morphological differences between groups are analyzed by the same concept but comparing group-specific atlases. Preliminary tests demonstrate that the atlas building shows excellent robustness and a very good convergence, i.e. atlases start to stabilize after 5 images only and do not show significant changes when including more than 10 volumetric images taken from the same population.

Applications of this method include geographical information systems, robot path planning, immersion and visualization, and surveying for scientific purposes such as watershed analysis. When given geo-registered images, the method can compute terrain maps on-line in real time. This algorithm, called the Recursive Multi-frame Planar Parallax algorithm, is a recursive extension of Irani et al.'s multi-frame planar parallax framework and in theory, with perfectly registered imagery, it will produce range data with error expected to increase between linearly and with the square root of the range, depending on image properties and whether other constants such as framerate and vehicle velocity are held constant. This is an improvement over stereo systems whose expected errors are proportional to the square of the range. We show experimental evidence on synthetic imagery and on a real video sequence taken in an experiment for autonomous helicopter landing.

#!3D imaging is a popular method for acquiring accurate models for a variety of applications. However, the size of the geometric features that can be modeled in this manner is dependant on the scanning system's resolution. This paper presents a method that attempts to accurately reconstruct regions whose features are at or below the system's scanning resolution, combining automatic region selection with a form of kriging. A curvature-based segmentation is followed by an automated geometry refinement procedure in which the model of spatial correlation between the irregularly sampled 3D data is automatically determined. Geometry refinement is done by a regularized kriging approach that is designed to preserve the sharp features typical to many 3D laser range applications. This method is validated on synthetic data, showing that the accuracy of our method is higher than that of its standard competitors. Then, the performance on real data is demonstrated through several examples.

#!We found previous intensity-based techniques for automatically registering color images to three-dimensional laser scanned scenes to be inadequate. The similarity metric used to score the registration creates a number of local minima that inhibits searching via Powell's Multidimensional Minimization Algorithm, a gradient-descent technique. To find the best metric for general environment scanning, we examine the results of different information-theoretic metrics. Our examination leads us to the conclusion that gradient-descent based techniques are not a good choice for unsupervised automatic registration for images from environment scans. However an unsupervised process is possible through global-optimization techniques at the cost of longer processing times.

Then another round of region matching is carried out to refine the motion values for the other regions. Our algorithm can detect most of the sky regions segmented by foreground objects with complex geometry while keeping the boundaries of moving objects sharp and clear, which is an very important feature to obtain accurate 3D models. The high quality motion maps/depth images obtained by our algorithm are shown along with 3D reconstructions from novel viewpoints.

#!Vanishing points are valuable in many vision tasks such as orientation estimation, pose recovery and 3D reconstruc-tion from a single image. Many methods have been pro-posed to address the problem, however, a consistent framework to quantitatively analyze the stability and ac-curacy of vanishing point estimation is still absent. This paper proposes a new concept, vanishing hull, which solves the problem. Given an edge error model, the range of a true edge can be modeled using a fan region. The intersection of all these fan regions is a convex hull, which is called vanishing hull. A vanishing hull gives the region of a true vanishing point, and its distribution determines the probability of the vanishing point. The expectation of the vanishing hull is the optimal solution of the vanishing point, its variance defines the accuracy of the estimation, and its shape determines the stability of the vanishing point. Hence, we can quantita-tively analyze the stability and accuracy of the vanishing point estimation using vanishing hull. Simulation results show that our method is significantly better than one state-of-the-art technique, and real data results are also promising.

#!It is common when analyzing experimental data to encounter matrices that have been contaminated by noise and have missing elements. Missing data can be recovered with imputation methods if the measurement data matrix is of low rank and the data is noise-free. However, iterative imputation can produce poor results for cases of large noise or a large proportion of missing data. Non-imputing methods rely on the use of existent data and require a selection of complete submatrices. Jacobs introduced a nonimputing method which can produce good results, but the randomness in selecting the submatrices cannot guarantee a consistently accurate recovery of missing data. Chen and Suter's method chooses the most reliable submatrix based on the number of missing data elements only, which fails to consider the effect of noise on the selected data. Herein, a new criterion based on an estimate of the sensitivity of submatrices to perturbation is introduced which takes into consideration that in some cases a column with more missing data could provide more useful information than one with less missing data. Experimental results for the problem of Structure from Motion with noisy point correspondences and missing data show that our criterion can sort submatrices properly in terms of their possible perturbation and recover the 3D structure of the scene more accurately than other non-imputing methods.

#!With advances in technology, a dynamic real world scene can be captured, represented, and streamed for realistic interaction in 3D using multiple digital cameras and computers. However, the captured data would be too massive to be streamed uncompressed. Fortunately, these data exhibit spatial and temporal coherence that can be utilized for compression, and research in compression of multiple streams has increased. To facilitate the use of spatial coherence between streams for multiple stream compression, reference streams must be selected. Reference streams are streams that serve as a basis for spatial prediction. Though the selection of reference streams affects encoding efficiency, there has been little research on it. In this paper, we identify the two main approaches for selecting reference streams, and demonstrate that when selecting reference streams, maximizing the volume overlap of reference streams and non-reference streams is more effective than maximizing volume coverage of the reference streams.

#!In this paper, we show the importance and feasibility of much faster multi-view stereo reconstruction algorithms relying almost exclusively on graphics hardware. Reconstruction algorithms have been steadily improving in the last few years and several state-of-the-art methods are nowadays reaching a very impressive level of quality. However all these modern techniques share a very lengthy computational time that completely forbids their more widespread use in practical setups: the typical running time of such algorithms range from one to several hours. One possible solution to this problem seems to lie in the use of graphics hardware: more and more computer vision techniques are taking advantage of the availability of cheap computational horsepower and divert graphics hardware from its original purpose to accelerate the early stages of some algorithms. We present here an almost full implementation on graphics hardware of a multi-view stereo algorithm based on surface deformation by a PDE: this algorithm tries to minimize the error between input images and predicted ones by reprojection via the surface. As it mainly works on whole images, it is well suited for graphics hardware. We show how we succeeded to bring the whole reconstruction time within minutes.

#!This paper demonstrates that, for axial non-central optical systems, the equation of a 3D line can be estimated using only four points extracted from a single image of the line. This result, which is a direct consequence of the lack of vantage point, follows from a classic result in enumerative geometry: there are exactly two lines in 3-space which intersect four given lines in general position. We present a simple algorithm to reconstruct the equation of a 3D line from four image points. This algorithm is based on computing the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the matrix of Plücker coordinates of the four corresponding rays. We evaluate the conditions for which the reconstruction fails, such as when the four rays are nearly coplanar. Preliminary experimental results using a spherical catadioptric camera are presented. We conclude by discussing the limitations imposed by poor calibration and numerical errors on the proposed reconstruction algorithm.

#!We address multiple-view reconstruction under an optimization approach based on belief propagation. A novel formulation of belief propagation that operates in 3-D is proposed to facilitate a true multi-image processing scheme that takes visibility into account and thus is applicable to scenes that contain significant occlusions. Visibility is not approximated but is estimated and used in a modified plane sweep stereo scheme. Optimization is performed in a simplified belief propagation framework in which messages are passed in 3-D, instead of 2-D, neighborhoods utilizing information from all available images. The information propagated from a point to one of its neighbors factors in the distance between the two points in 3-D, their difference in color. In contrast to traditional belief propagation, the observation is updated at each iteration to incorporate changes in visibility. The proposed approach is capable of enforcing smoothness on the evolving 3-D surfaces without being limited to a coarse resolution due to a volumetric representation. Moreover, our approach is applicable to both open and closed surfaces with no need for a priori knowledge of the type. We present dense reconstructions of publicly available image sets.

#!As more and more human motion data are widely used to animate computer graphics figures in many applications, there is an imperative need to compress motion data for compact storage and fast transmission. We propose a data-driven method for efficient compression of human motion sequences by exploiting both spatial and temporal coherences of the data. We first segment a motion sequence into subsequences such that the poses within a subsequence lie near a low dimensional linear space. We then compress each segment using the principal component analysis. Further compression is achieved by storing only the key frames' projections to the principal component space and interpolating the other frames in-between the key frames via spline functions. The experimental results show that our method can achieve significant compression rate with low reconstruction errors.

#!The traditional ICP algorithm is a de facto standard approach for range image registration. While it assumes that one data set is a subset of another, this assumption is often violated in practice. As a result, a number of algorithms have been developed to first eliminate false matches due to occlusion, appearance and disappearance of points and then estimate the camera motion parameters in the least squares sense. Instead of eliminating outliers in the process of image registration, we in this paper use the generalised entropy to estimate the probability of correspondences established using the traditional closest point criterion, leading camera motion parameters to be estimated in the weighted least squares sense. For more accurate registration results, we also learn from the probability of correspondences estimated in the past. Since one point in one data set can only correspond to a single point in another, the two way constraint is also imposed. Finally the camera motion parameters are optimized using the powerful mean field annealing scheme. A comparative study based on real images has shown that the proposed algorithm produces promising automatic range image registration results.

#!In conventional TV, users can get only a single view of a real 3D world. The view is determined not by a user but by the camera position during acquisition. Free viewpoint television (FTV) is a new concept which aims at giving viewers the flexibility to select a novel viewpoint by employing multiple video streams as the input. Current proposed solutions for FTV include those based on ray-space sampling and interpolation. Most existing work makes the assumption that the cameras are calibrated. Moreover, virtual view specification is done in ways that would not be practical for actual use (e.g., some methods specify the virtual view by a rotation matrix and a translation vector). This paper proposes a framework for FTV based on image-based rendering, complete with key algorithms for color-based segmentation and correspondence, and multiple-image-based virtual view synthesis from uncalibrated cameras. Moreover, we propose an intuitive approach to specifying the virtual viewpoint, based on any two views chosen by the user. This makes the specification of the virtual view very intuitive and thus practical for the FTV application. Experiments with real video streams were performed to validate the proposed approaches.

#index4565
#!This paper presents a new technique for estimating a multi-view reconstruction given pair-wise Euclidean reconstructions up to rotations, translations and scales. The partial reconstructions are glued by the following three step procedure: (i) Camera rotations consistent with all reconstructions are estimated linearly. (ii) All the pair-wise reconstructions are modified according to the new rotations and refined by bundle adjustment while keeping the corresponding rotations same. (iii) The refined rotations are used to estimate both camera translations and 3D points using Second Order Cone Programming by minimizing the L1- norm. We introduce a new criterion for evaluating importance of an epipolar geometry in influence on the overall 3D geometry. The estimated importance is used to re-weight data in the above algorithm to better handle unequiponderantly captured images. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated on difficult wide base-line image sets.

#!This paper addresses the problem of face recognition in the presence of facial deformations caused by expressions. An isometric mapping between surfaces is assumed, which allows preservation of geodesic distance between facial points. Subject to this assumption, we propose a novel technique which integrates 2D and 3D information to establish a new deformation invariant representation of the face. The 3D surface is used to define a polar geodesic coordinate space which is independent of the intrinsic geometry of the face. The corresponding color image is embedded in this space and serves as the recognition data. A preceding stage of hierarchical diffeomorphic grid-based image warping before the recognition process combined with a lip segmentation technique are also employed to increase the overall performance of the algorithm.

#!Users know what they see before where they are: it is more natural to talk about high level visibility information ("I see such object") than about one's location or orientation. In this paper we introduce a method to find in 3D worlds a density of viewpoints of camera locations from high level visibility constraints on objects in this world. Our method is based on Rao-Blackwellized importance sampling. For efficiency purposes, the proposal distribution used for sampling is extracted from a visibility preprocessing technique adapted from computer graphics. We apply the method for finding in a 3D city model of Atlanta the virtual locations of real-world cameras and viewpoints.

The primary goal of this study was to come to an initial understanding of what features and dimensions of a humanoid robot's face most dramatically contribute to people's perception of its humanness. To answer this question we analyzed 48 robots and conducted surveys to measure people's perception of each robot's humanness. Through our research we found that the presence of certain features, the dimensions of the head, and the total number of facial features heavily influence the perception of humanness in robot heads. This paper presents our findings and initial guidelines for the design of humanoid robot heads.

#!Making the invisible visible in the world of mobile communication. The ubiquitous presence of mobile communication devices - and the fashion in which they are adopted by different cultures - is not only redefining the way people communicate but also the way they more generally behave. Mobile communication devices, particularly mobile phones, introduce a digital space overlapping the physical space of the body: the birth of this hybrid space brings along a number of social consequences, most of which still invisible, hard to map and to explain. Adopting a critical approach in creating wearable probes apt to explore and illustrate this space is here proposed as a valuable strategy in order to make the invisible visible in the world of mobile communication. In Fashion Victims we chose clothing as the medium for making this invisible world visible; we have designed a collection of garments that react (respond and change) according to the surrounding mobile phone calls. We want to see what would happen if our clothes - everyday objects that we carry on our person - were able to display this presence. The metaphor we have decided to use for visualizing mobile communication comes directly from nature: clothes, as a second skin, react to the environment and change in color. Here, as more and more phone calls are conducted in their surroundings, the clothes progressively and permanently change color. Fashion Victims subverts the expected behavior of an everyday object to create and raise awareness about the subject of mobile communication. By producing a physical result with every call, the mobile phone is revealed in all of its pervasiveness and intrusiveness: its tendency to violate the private space we potentially have within the public context. http://www.fashionvictims.org.

#!This paper examines an under explored area of digital photography, namely photo display. Using examples from a study undertaken with six families, we examine photo displays on mantelpieces, sideboards, and hallway walls, and in homeoffices. Using the examples, we make a case relating to the material properties of photo displays, suggesting that families routinely (and often unintentionally) express something of themselves in the ways they display their photos. The very ideas of family and home, we suggest, are tightly interwoven with the methods of photo display. This position is used to offer up some early design considerations for digital photo displays. We outline some basic properties that might be designed around and contend that the ideas of family and home impose constraints on which of these properties might be best combined and exploited. We also present three design concepts to illustrate how we have been developing this position.

#!Aesthetics and interaction are interwoven concepts, rather than separate entities. An aesthetics of interaction must consider richness in appearance, actions, and role. Moving beyond a narrow focus on usability in this way requires new methods for understanding design possibilities. Here we describe two: interaction relabelling, in which possible interactions with a known mechanical device are mapped to the functions of an electronic device to be designed; and extreme characters, in which fictional users with exaggerated emotional attitudes are taken as the basis of design to highlight cultural issues. These methods may help designers in considering physical interactions with products on the one hand, and the sociocultural role their products will take on the other.

What are the best principles, affordances and techniques of interactive design, what are some examples, and how should designers approach this challenge? This panel explores an approach called Productive Interaction, which views interaction as a medium that enables the user as producer of her own outcomes and meanings. Productive interaction aligns the design of not-linear content, context and affordance in an open, collaborative fashion, enabling the direct manipulation of the work's material. Taking advantage of this facilitation, the user creates a custom, personally significant meaning space of their own.A faculty member and three students present perspectives from their work in the Graduate Media Design Program at Art Center College of Design: Philip van Allen (moderator): Design principles, techniques, and experiments in Productive InteractionScott Nazarian: Futurism as a design methodologyJen Tarara: Relationship aware systems - 2Degrees Network, a mobile application and serviceDavid Keady: Sound as a low attention information system.

#!In recent years, affordances have been hailed by the interaction design community as the key to solving usability problems. Most interpretations see affordances as 'inviting the user to the right action'. In this paper we argue that the essence of usability in electronic products lies not in communicating the necessary action and instead shift our attention to feedforward and inherent feedback. With feedforward we mean communication of the purpose of an action. This is essentially a matter of creating meaning and we discuss two approaches to do so. With inherent feedback we try to strengthen the coupling between the action and the feedback. The sensory richness and action potential of physical objects can act as carriers of meaning in interaction. We thus see tangible interaction as indispensable in realizing feedforward and inherent feedback. We illustrate our ideas with examples from our teaching and research.

We reiterate arguments for and against using critical parameters to characterize user goals and usability artifacts. Responding to residual arguments, we suggest that clear advantages for research cohesion, design knowledge reuse, and HCI education are possible if several challenges are overcome. As a first step, we recommend a slight variation to the concept of a critical parameter, which would allow both abstract and concrete knowledge representation. With this concept, we demonstrate a feasible approach by introducing equations that elaborate and allow evolution of notification system critical parameters, which is made operational with a variety of usability evaluation instruments. A case study illustrates how one general instrument allowed system designs to be meaningfully compared and resulted in valuable inferences for interface reengineering. Broad implications and conclusions about this approach will be of interest to others concerned with using critical parameters in interface design, development of notification systems interfaces, or approaches to design rationale and knowledge reuse.

#!Blendie is an interactive, sensitive, intelligent, voice controlled blender with a mind of its own. Materials are a 1950's Osterizer blender altered with custom made hardware and software for sound analysis and motor control. People induce the blender to spin by sounding the sounds of its motor in action. If they make their voice sufficiently blender-like, then Blendie will begin to pitch-track and power-match their voice with its own motor body. For example, a person may growl low pitch blender-like sounds to get it to spin slowly, and the person may growl blenderstyle at higher pitches to speed up Blendie. The experience for the participant is to speak the language of the machine, to resonate with the machine, and thus to more deeply understand and connect with it. The action may also bring about personal revelations in the participant, because in sounding with the blender one is likely to perform gesture and sound expressions not previously accessed which may open up unfound emotions or thoughts or feelings. An empathic opportunity is made manifest emphasizing and utilizing the aspects of motorized machines that are not what have been traditionally designed into them intentionally - i.e. their incredible sound and vibration - but that nevertheless have large roles in our interaction and approach to them. http://web.media.mit.edu/~monster/blendie.

#!Item selection is a key problem in electronic guidebook design. Many systems do not apply so-called context-awareness technologies to infer user interest, placing the entire burden of selection on the user. Conversely, to make selection easier, many systems automatically eliminate information that they infer is not of interest to the user. However, such systems often eliminate too much information, preventing the user from finding what they want.To realize the full potential of electronic guidebooks, designers must strike the right balance between automatic context-based inference and manual selection. In this paper, we introduce a task-oriented model of item selection for electronic guidebooks to help designers explore this continuum. We argue that item selection contains three sub-tasks and that these sub-tasks should be considered explicitly in system design. We apply our model to existing systems, demonstrating pitfalls of combining sub-tasks, and discuss how our model has improved the design of our own guidebook prototype.

#!One challenge for ubiquitous computing is providing appropriate tools for professional designers, thus leading to stronger user-valued applications. Unlike many previous tool-builders' attempts to support a specific technology, we take a designer-centered stance, asking the question: how do professional designers externalize ideas for off-the-desktop computing and how do these inform next generation design tools? We report on interviews with designers from various domains, including experience, interaction, industrial, and space designers. The study broadly reveals perceived challenges of moving into a non-traditional design medium, emphasizes the practice of storytelling for relating the context of interaction, and through two case studies, traces the use of various external representations during the design progression of ubicomp applications. Using paperprototyped "walkthroughs" centered on two common design representations (storyboards and physical simulations), we formed a deeper understanding of issues influencing tool development. We offer guidelines for builders of future ubicomp tools, especially early-stage conceptual tools for professional designers to prototype applications across multiple sensors, displays, and physical environments.

#!Modern user interface design methods, regardless of their extremely diverse viewpoints, all seem to agree that a document outlining a task analysis is essential for good user interface design. However, most representations of task analysis are difficult to understand. This difficulty makes the transition to dialogue design difficult, especially for multidisciplinary design teams with few shared skills and terminology. Using techniques borrowed from the study of parallel processing, the authors have developed a technique of task analysis representation called Task Layer Maps. Task Layer Maps are both quick and easy to understand. This technique helps design teams to quickly come up with a dialogue design and also allows checking that design for conformance with the task analysis.

#!Many sources of empirical data can be used to evaluate an interface (e.g., time to learn, time to perform benchmark tasks, number of errors on benchmark tasks, answers on questionnaires, comments made in verbal protocols). This paper examines the relative contributions of both quantiðtaðtive and qualitative data gathered during a usability study. For each usability problem uncovered by this study, we trace each contributing piece of evidence back to its empirical source. For this usability study, the verbal protocol provided the sole source of evidence for more than one third of the most severe problems and more than two thirds of the less severe problems. Thus, although the verbal protocol provided the bulk of the evidence, other sources of data contributed disproportionately to the more critical problems. This work suggests that further research is required to determine the relative value of different forms of empirical evidence.

#!Design is a term that brings many people together. Collectively, we distinguish ourselves from others by the fact that we are designers and members of a design community. But, design is also a term that pushes people apart. The design that some value in the new fashions in the boutiques in Milan is not seen by everyone as design. While some are impressed with the design of a new telephone, not everyone sees this as design. As a community, we believe design is important. But, as a community, we do not have a common definition of what it is. Many views of design have been proposed. Several classifications of design have been proposed. In this paper, we also seek to classify views on design. Unlike earlier efforts, however, we want to find the classification that the global community of designers uses. To this end, we examine the patterns of citations to key authors' works (Author Co-citation Analysis) to uncover this classification and identify seven key author clusters representing identifiable theory groups or schools of thought/practice in design.

While having evaluation inform design and having design inform evaluation is a goal that few would disagree with, how this might be done has not been extensively addressed. The evaluation community (often labeled the usability community) focuses primarily on the evaluation of designed artifacts while the design community focuses primarily on the design of artifacts that will be evaluated later. Design and evaluation both share the common goal of usability but each takes a different path in trying to achieve it. Our goal is to further explore the relationships between design and evaluation in an attempt to understand how they can be brought together meaningfully.

#!Nomadic work, an extreme form of mobile work, is becoming increasingly prevalent in organizations. Yet so far there has not been enough research attention on the particular challenges that nomadic workers face in order to design support for their work practices. We employed ethnographic interviews and observations to understand nomadic work practices. Drawing from strategies for survival of pastoralist nomads to guide our design investigation, we focus on an integrated perspective of nomadic work involving challenges related to assembling actants, seeking resources, and integrating with others in the organization. We discovered that nomadic workers need to continually seek out and compete for resources to maintain their mobile offices. They also face challenges in integrating into the organization to maintain visibility and to synchronize with others for meeting. We discuss the design recommendations that emerged from our investigation.

#!The current practice used in the design of physical interactive products (such as handheld devices), often suffers from a divide between exploration of form and exploration of interactivity. This can be attributed, in part, to the fact that working prototypes are typically expensive, take a long time to manufacture, and require specialized skills and tools not commonly available in design studios.We have designed a prototyping tool that, we believe, can significantly reduce this divide. The tool allows designers to rapidly create functioning, interactive, physical prototypes early in the design process using a collection of wireless input components (buttons, sliders, etc.) and a sketch of form. The input components communicate with Macromedia Director to enable interactivity.We believe that this tool can improve the design practice by: a) Improving the designer's ability to explore both the form and interactivity of the product early in the design process, b) Improving the designer's ability to detect problems that emerge from the combination of the form and the interactivity, c) Improving users' ability to communicate their ideas, needs, frustrations and desires, and d) Improving the client's understanding of the proposed design, resulting in greater involvement and support for the design.

#!The game design process is largely driven by practice. While some work has been done in academia targeting the definition of a theoretical foundation for the process of game design, these two communities rarely came together to discuss their perspective theories or processes. As a result, both communities work in isolation. The game industry is often involved in game-specific game design methodologies and academics are concerned with theoretical foundations. The goal of this workshop is to start a dialogue between the two communities and generate general themes and underlying theories. These theories will serve to aid game designers in constructing games, and help tool designers build tools that allow designers to focus on critical issue.

#!Can 3D graphics help high-school students learn advanced mathematics? Can we create a sufficiently compelling application such that students would choose to play with advanced math concepts for fun? What usability problems does this technology pose for novice users? AquaMOOSE 3D is a desktop 3D environment designed to help students learn about the behavior of parametric equations. AquaMOOSE is based on an educational philosophy called constructionism, which advocates learning through design and construction activities [14]. Students use mathematics to design interesting graphical forms and also create mathematical challenges to share with others. In this paper, we present our iterative design process and the results from a formative evaluation with 105 high-school students in a six-week honors summer math program. We analyse their experiences through log-file analysis, a questionnaire, and interviews. A more detailed case study of one student's positive experiences shows the potential of the system. We conclude that students find the aesthetic qualities of the environment motivating, but usability still poses problems. Opportunities and challenges in leveraging 3D graphics for math learning are discussed. Trade-offs are presented between designing for learner's immediate needs versus leveraging technology to create fundamentally new learning opportunities.

#!I:move is a performance / installation series that explores how we perceive movement. It embeds daily activities into formal choreography and is being developed for public spaces that are bottlenecks of human motion. It has been shown at MIT's IM Pei archway and the DTW gallery space.Pedestrian traffic is tracked and transformed into 2-dimensional shadow play. Continuous motion trails occur like reliable yet unpredictable weather patterns. I:move captures and processes these daytime patterns, imbedding them into video projection. Pedestrians become performers. Live motion folds into the piece, revealing layers of text or motion streams that echo earlier daytime movements in the space. Through i:move, your motion reveals varying speeds, rhythms and dynamic patterns occurring at the site, over a 24-hour cycle. I:move encourages dancers and novices to explore their own movements, in relation to the routine, theater, and ritual of cycles in a public space.I:move considers human movements over multiple time scales, perspectives, and magnifications. Video processing is used to enhance contrast, reveal coincidences, and layer time-coded realities. Interactive video is used to engage viewers in playful experimentation. Audiences create and perform inside the motion projections. In this way, i:move celebrates the personal and collective movements of each day.The i:move series is rendered entirely by a stream processing lisp dialect called Gooze. Gooze is a concise, powerful, and efficient expression of time-oriented computing allowing highly profitable domain specific optimizations. It is a unique design, combining movementcentric parameters to extract the perceptual features of motion from video.

#!A central challenge in interaction design has to do with its diversity. Designers, engineers, managers, marketers, researchers and users all have important contributions to make to the design process. But at the same time they lack shared concepts, experiences and perspectives. How is the process of design-which requires communication, negotiation and compromise-to effectively proceed in the absence of a common ground? I argue that an important role for the interaction designer is to help stakeholders in the design process to construct alingua franca.To explore this issue, which has received remarkably little attention in HCI, I turn to work in urban design and architecture. I begin by discussing a case study in community design, reported by Hester [10], that demonstrates the power of alingua francafor a particular design project. I then describe the concept of pattern languages and discuss how they might be adapted to the needs of interaction design in general, and used, in particular, as meta-languages for generatinglingua francasfor particular design projects.

#!Virtual studio technology enables the mixing of physical and digital 3D objects and thus expands the way of representing design ideas in terms of virtual video prototypes, which offers new possibilities for designers by combining elements of prototypes, mock-ups, scenarios, and conventional video. In this article we report our initial experience in the domain of pervasive healthcare with producing virtual video prototypes and using them in a design workshop. Our experience has been predominantly favourable. The production of a virtual video prototype forces the designers to decide very concrete design issues, since one cannot avoid paying attention to the physical, real-world constraints and to details in the usage-interaction between users and technology. From the users' perspective, during our evaluation of the virtual video prototype, we experienced how it enabled users to relate to the practicalities and context of applied technology. One of the main limitations experienced in the creation of the virtual video prototypes is the lack of user-involvement.

#!Rabbit Field is an infestation of inflatable rabbit-like forms, filling their display space and inviting tactile interaction. They cover much of the floor, and any other available surfaces, growing in number each night. Each rabbit is self-inflating using a simple computer fan, and can sense its internal pressure state by monitoring its fan speed. If a rabbit is squeezed, and partially deflated, the rabbits around it respond, as if out of empathy, deflating themselves. In this way, a wave of deflation ripples out from the squeezed center. By connecting an entire field of forms into a network of sensors and output media, interactions between viewer and inflatable are further displayed and amplified as deflation data is passed from one rabbit to the next. The organic feel of the forms and the rhythm of their inflation and deflation in reaction to human touch are easily anthropomorphized by the audience as simple expressions of emotion. This initiates and encourages play and exploration. This piece seeks to encourage and reward a 'tangible dialogue' between viewer and inflatables, as well as hoping to establish social connection between viewers who co-interact with the system. Rabbit forms were chosen to engage and invite inquiry. These animals also have strong cultural connotations of fertility and innocence, and are prevalent images in modern eastern and western aesthetic. Use of the unique properties of inflatable structures in architecture, art and design has a long and creative history, flirting between chic design and tacky novelty. http://www.media.mit.edu/~bcd/rabbits.

#!In real world development environments where deadlines are fixed, a designer must craft a process that works with the team and within the constraints of a project. The traditional waterfall method of writing a detailed specification for each feature before development begins is often not realistic. Instead, by using a just-in-time design method, the designer understands how much design direction is needed at each stage of the development process, and delivers that. The larger components must be well defined initially, while other parts can be left sketchy. The designer can spread the workload over the entire length of the project, using different steps to refine the design. Delivering the design in stages gives the design a chance to mature.Often there are many developers and few (usually 1) designers on a project. The designer is often on the critical path. To avoid being a bottleneck, the designer should use good tools and leverage the strengths of a multi-disciplinary team.The case study documented here should prove useful to other user interface designers facing resource and time constraints. A design process derived from this experience is summarized at the end.

#!Usability and design professionals know that user requirements gathering is critical to the development of quality products. However, development teams often skip formal user requirements gathering, fearing it will take too long. Certain techniques can be employed by design professionals that are easily learned and implemented with little overhead. They can help designers by providing insight into how users work and what they need to succeed at their task. Through lecture, case studies, and an emphasis on hands-on activities, participants will learn how to conduct three user requirements gathering techniques and incorporate the results into design solutions.

#!Through theoretical influences, particularly drawing on the phenomenological notion of embodiment, and through the findings of an ethnographic study of the work practice of service technicians at two industrial assembly manufacturing units, we present the philosophy behind and practice in designing a mobile support system for real-life application. In this particular setting, we have come to question both the usefulness of the currently available and applied styles of interaction, and the role such a system should play in the everyday activities of service and maintenance. In this paper, we introduce the findings of the field study and explain how these findings have been interpreted to constitute design incentives. We especially focus on three aspects of the design of the prototype system: the functionality it encompasses; the interaction style with which the user performs input to the device; and the mobile prototype's graphical user interface

#!Rapid technological change requires that system designers explore potential design spaces widely before committing to a local design space in which to evolve a problem solution. We discuss an approach for doing this, which we base on an analogy with an approach used by graphic designers. We have observed that our colleagues in the graphic design community begin exploring a problem space by generating multiple, divergent design ideas. They then proceed to elaborate them -- extending, combining and discarding -- as the problem space dictates. We illustrate our adaptation of this approach with a case study of our initial design work on a system for supporting self-service sales of information technology (IT).

#!We describe our experience of trying to develop a novel application that transforms information management (both coordination-based and personal) from stand-alone resources into resources deeply embedded in email. We explored two models for accomplishing this goal; these were to embed these resources in the email channel and to embed them in the client. Our exploration of the first model was intensive, in-depth and ultimately unsuccessful in large part due to our design process. We adopted Extreme Programming (XP) as a means to explore our second model more efficiently. This paper describes our motivations and experiences while exploring our first model before XP and then the advantages and disadvantages of turning to XP in the exploration of our second model.

#!MessyDesk is a replacement desktop that invites free-form decoration. MessyBoard is a large, projected, shared bulletin board that is decorated collaboratively by a small group of users.We built these programs with the goal of helping people remember more of the content that they access through a computer. Our approach is to embed content within distinct contexts. For instance, a computer with multiple projection screens could surround the user with panoramic vistas that correspond to projects that the user is working on. Since few people are willing to create their own context, we created MessyDesk and MessyBoard in order to entice people to decorate.Though we have not yet evaluated the impact of either program on users' memories, we have observed people using these programs over a several week period. From anecdotal evidence, we believe that MessyDesk may be a good tool for decoration and information management. MessyBoard became popular when we projected the board on the wall in our lab. We have seen that different research groups use it differently. One group uses it mostly for jokes and games, and another group uses it for long design discussions. It is good for scheduling, and supports factual as well as emotional communication among group members.

Initially, the system was conceived as a paper-based UI to calendar, contacts, to-dos and notes. As the fieldwork progressed, our understanding of peoples practices and the constraints of their office infrastructures radically shifted our design goals away from paper-based interaction to embedded interaction with our system. By this we mean embedding information management functionality in an existing application such as email.

#!This paper documents the design process for an augmented children's play environment centred on that most ubiquitous and simple of objects, the cardboard box. The purpose of the exercise is to show how computer technology can be used in innovative ways to stimulate discovery, play and adventure among children. Our starting point was a dissatisfaction with current computer technology as it is presented to children, which, all to often in our view, focuses inappropriately on the computer per se as a fetishized object. Shifting the focus of attention from the Graphical User Interface (GUI) to familiar objects, and children's interactions around and through these augmented objects, results in the computer becoming a facilitator of exploration and learning. The paper documents the journey from initial design concept, through a number of prototype implementations, to the final implementation. Each design iteration was triggered by observation of use of the prototypes, and reflection on that use, and on new design possibilities. By augmenting an everyday artefact, namely the standard cardboard box, we have created a simple yet powerful interactive environment that, judging from the experience of our "users", has achieved its goal of stirring children's imagination.

#!Project design involves an initial selection of technologies, which has strong consequences for later stages of design. In this paper we describe an ethnographic-based field work study of a complex organization, and how it addressed the issue of front-end project and technology selection. Formal procedures were designed for the organization to perform repeatable, definable, and measurable actions. Yet, formal procedures obscured much about the processes actually being applied in selecting technologies and projects. In actuality, the formal procedures were interwoven with sensemaking activities so that technologies could be understood, compared, and a decision consensus could be reached. We expect that the insights from this study can benefit design teams in complex organizations facing similar selection and requirements issues.

#!Re-Tracing the Past: exploring objects, stories, mysteries, was an exhibition held at the Hunt Museum, in Limerick, Ireland from 9th--19th June 2003. We attempted to create an exhibition that would be an engaging experience for visitors, that would open avenues for exploration, allow for the collection of visitor opinions,and that would add to the understanding of material already in the Museum,rather than focus on "gee-whiz" technology. Thus our augmented environment completely hid the technology from view. A key objective was to be faithful to the ethos of the Museum, and to produce an exhibition that would stand up to scrutiny by Museum professionals. This design study paper gives a flavour of the exhibition by taking the reader on a tour of the whole design and development cycle-through site pictures, drawings, scenarios, pictures of the exhibition spaces, the interactive components, and visitor comments.

The paper presents future work scenarios from a wastewater treatment plant embodying PDA applications derived from the classification of augmented reality interfaces. The focus on physical interaction with objects of work and with the mobile device provides us with a range of interaction styles, based on e.g. gestures and manipulation of objects. Furthermore, issues of transparency and directness are addressed. The future scenarios indicate that the concepts of augmented reality support solving context problems in mobile design.

#!Studies on the widespread inefficient use of complex computer applications have suggested that users need to learn efficient strategies in addition to learning how to use tools. This paper argues that our growing understanding of strategic knowledge can be used to guide designers develop systems which are conducive to the use of efficient strategies. The paper first describes ten general strategies which appear to be useful across three computer application domains. Next, the paper discusses the functionalities required to execute the ten strategies, and what makes them conducive to strategy use. An analysis of six major computer applications in three domains reveals that these functionalities are not consistently offered, and how their absence directly affects the performance of complex tasks. The analysis leads to questions related to the generality of the results, the problem of featurism, and how strategy-conducive systems could facilitate the transfer of knowledge across applications. The paper concludes by briefly describing how we intend to use the strategy framework to develop analysis methods for designers and trainers.

#!One fundamental challenge for the design of the interactive systems of the future is to invent and design environments and cultures in which humans can express themselves and engage in personally meaningful activities. Unfortunately, a large number of new media are designed from a perspective of viewing and treating humans primarily as consumers. The possibility for humans to be and act as designers (in cases in which they desire to do so) should be accessible not only to a small group of high-tech scribes, but rather to all interested individuals and groups. Meta-design characterizes activities, processes, and objectives to create new media and environments that allow users to act as designers and be creative.In this paper we discuss problems addressed by our research on meta-design, provide a conceptual framework for meta-design, and illustrate our developments in the context of a particular system, the Envisionment and Discovery Collaboratory.

We demonstrate that this interactive music system embraces both the novice and musically trained participants by taking advantage of their intuitive abilities and social interaction skills. In this paper and accompanying video, we present conclusions from user testing of this device along with examples of interaction design methods and prototypes of interpretive musical and game-like development schemes. Our research was conducted in two phases with two different development teams and will accordingly be addressed herein as Phase One and Phase Two development.

To understand experience and the user experience that results from interacting with products, designers conduct situated research activities focused on the interactions between people and products, and the experience that results. This paper attempts to clarify experience in interactive systems. We characterize current approaches to experience from a number of disciplines, and present a framework for designing experience for interactive system. We show how the framework can be applied by members of a multidisciplinary team to understand and generate the kinds of interactions and experiences new product and system designs might offer.

#!As a context for IT design, flexible work presents a new challenge. Ways of working tend to be prototypical, habits are forming slowly and work is carried out everywhere. Even when applying ethnographic methods, it is difficult to capture the ephemerality and prototypicality of cooperative work that Grudin claims must be preserved through design. Through a discussion of a design project dedicated to the design of support for social awareness, we reflect on the means of design - scenarios and prototypes, and their ability to support design for ephemerality and prototypicality. Our conclusion is that by using scenarios as boundary objects, in multiple prototyping experiments, they support the negotiation and boundary understanding of design ideas, rather than one or more solutions. Hence it becomes possible to design to preserve ephemerality and prototypicality.

Particularly, we investigate tools of design, i.e. tools used in design to get ideas for a new interactive application and its use.Based on different studies from a research project that we have been involved with over the past three years, we present specific examples of such tools and discuss how they inform design. We frame this discussion through the following (theoretical) considerations: a concern for the past and the present in informing design, for using theory as a source of inspiration in design and for making extremes and multiple voices play a role in innovation.These considerations are used to structure and discuss the examples, illustrating how it is important for such tools to be concrete, tangible and even caricatured.

The SoundCam is the most visible part of the Recycling Soundscapes system. It rotates scanning a public space and gives the possibility to spy and to record audio details and voices in the space, even at the big distance. Paradoxically the people in the context involuntary become the center of auditory attention, while the importance of spy fades as the voices start coming out from Sonic Bowls. The Sonic Bowls are instruments that invite passers-by to play with sounds coming from their environment: birds, footsteps, voices. These are collaboratively composed into a new soundscape through SonicBowl interface. The voices are played back randomly as surprise voice messages and build the sound memory of the place. http://www.interaction-ivrea.it/theses/2003-04/architectureofsubtraction/ReSound.htm

A Pattern Approach to Interactive Design remedies this situation, providing for the first time an introduction to the concepts and application of patterns in user interface design. The author shows interface designers how to structure and capture user interface design knowledge from their projects and learn to understand each others design principles and solutions. Key features of this book include a comprehensive pattern language for the interface design of interactive exhibits as well as a thorough introduction to original pattern work and its application in software development. The book also offers invaluable practical guidance for interface designers, project managers, and researchers working in HCI, as well as for designers of interactive systems.

#!A context-descriptive prototype is an interactive graphical animation, driven by a formal, executable engine, implemented in some programming or modelling language. The two main properties of a context-descriptive prototype are: (1) it is an integrated description that describes system, work processes, and context of use; (2) it is a formal description. Because of (1), designers, including users, are provided with a means to investigate the system in the context of the envisioned work processes. Because of (2), investigations into questions of formalisation and automation, not only of the system, but also of the work processes, can be made explicitly and become subject for discussions and further elaboration. We describe a concrete context-descriptive prototype of the hospital work process medicine administration and its support by a new pervasive system. We discuss findings from evaluation of the prototype in cooperation with nurses, and finally compare context-descriptive prototypes with other kinds of prototypes.

#!The development of navigational tools for a web site devoted to a catalog of musical compositions offers a variety of design challenges. A combination of techniques developed from information visualization research - including starfield displays, dynamic queries, and zoomable user interfaces (ZUIs) - was used to construct a prototype browser for possible use in a web site dedicated to the work of Philip Glass. After a discussion of the goals and potential users of the site, this paper describes several prototypes that were developed and how they informed the design of a zoomable starfield browser. Unresolved design challenges and possibilities for future work are also discussed.

#!The physical environment plays a large role in the design and use of technology. So called "context-aware" systems use ultrasound, GPS or cell-tracking, to work out their position and infer something of their context [9]. These systems offer the possibility of technology which responds better to the environments it is in [4], and also technologies which interact with the physical world in new ways [5]. Through these developments technology is increasingly taking on a geographical aspect, as it both disappears into the environment, and in turn make increasing use of that environment.Along with this work there is increasing interest in a more conceptual consideration of how we interact with the physical environment, and how we might think about the relationship of the environment to technology [11]. As HCI conceptualised the user, and CSCW, collaborative activity, with these new technologies there is a need to consider the physical environment and the role that geography could play in technology use and design. In this paper we discuss through these issues using the concepts of "space" and "place" from human geography. Our aim here is to inform design through developing a conceptual understanding of the geography of technology; something lacking in many discussions of context-awareness. If we are to design new technologies for the city, how is the city experienced and what form does in take? In particular how can we design technologies that take better account of the physical location of users, and their movements?

#!Design for hackability encourages designers and non-designers to critically and creatively explore interactivity, technology and media - to reclaim authorship and ownership of technologies and the social and cultural worlds in which we live. Hackability implies more than customization or adaptation - it calls for redefinition. In a world where technologies are increasingly mobile and invisible, designing for hackability means allowing and encouraging people to make technologies be what they want them to be. It cultivates reciprocity between users and designers and supports transparency and graceful responses to unanticipated uses. Before entering into a broader discussion with the audience, panelists will discuss tensions between people and artifacts, technology and play, the creative use of readily available resources, subverting traditional functions and uses of networks, and the everyday realities of corporate design practice. These discussions will be used to generate a design for hackability manifesto to guide further explorations in designing interactive systems.

#!Music has lost its role as a central part of many people's everyday action. This paper reports on the design and impact of a novel environment for remote group music improvisation with the view to understanding how we could design more engaging, social, and serendipitous musical environments. The design reported here focuses on the representation of looping music, support for remote collaboration, and support for idea formulation. Observations of use suggest that the environment developed does encourage some group music, and we identify clear areas for future design consideration.

#!Several researchers have recently proposed technology for crowd-and-DJ interactions in nightclub environments. However, these attempts have not always met with success. In order to design better technologies and systems in this area, it is important to start with an understanding of how nightclub interaction currently happens. To build this understanding, we carried out an interview study focusing on DJ-audience interactions. We interviewed eleven DJs from several different cities, and asked them to discuss the ways that they interact with the audience, and the ways that they maintain and use awareness of the audience. We found that DJs gather a wide variety of information about their audiences, and that this information is important to them as they plan and shape the evening's musical experience. DJs are adept at gathering visual information about the audience, despite poor lighting conditions and a heavy workload of selecting and mixing music. Despite the difficulties, DJs took a dim view of technology designed to let crowds exert more control over the music. This study is one of the first to look closely at the interactive relationship between the DJ and the nightclub audience through the lens of HCI, and our findings provide a number of guidelines for the design of new DJ-focused nightclub technologies.

#!In this paper we identify and characterize, in theory and by design example, a new genre of pervasive play for tweens that lies on the border between play and game, called mock games. The objective is to design digital support for more or less structured playfulness among preteen children, primarily girls, in a way that emphasizes humor, friendly battle and identity construction. The method used is a combination of a review of a number of theories of games and play and a field study into the social reality of children's playful activities. Based on these two investigations we characterize mock games as a genre and show that it is not covered well by any one of the reviewed theories, taking into account both social and technical aspects. Then we present a design example of such a system, DARE! We conclude by discussing ethical issues and set goals for future research.
